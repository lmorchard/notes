						<p>Hello world.</p><hr><p>Haven't done a lot of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Work%2520with%2520the%2520garage%2520door%2520up.html">working with the garage door up</a> lately.</p><p>Mostly been trying to get work done during the day. Distract myself from doomscrolling with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="EVE%2520Echoes.html">EVE Echoes</a> until my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="ADHD.html">ADHD</a> brain decides we're done with it. </p><p>Kind of hoping I can bargain with myself to do some more creative work like I started with my &quot;<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://lmorchard.github.io/swinth2020/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Swinth 2020</a>&quot; demo back on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="2020%2520%252F%252009%2520%252F%252016.html">2020 / 09 / 16</a> or maybe some continued <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="GameDev.html">GameDev</a> on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Starnet.html">Starnet</a>.</p><p>I think I've come to a place where I'm accepting that I can't browbeat or shame myself into doing any particular kind of creative work. Can't force the mechanism. For awhile, I internalized &quot;<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="butt%2520in%2520seat.html">butt in seat</a>&quot; and force myself to do the thing as the way to go. But, all that does is make me feel absolutely terrible and a failure. </p><p>Assuming <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="ADHD.html">ADHD</a> is my malady, the lack of executive function renders &quot;<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="butt%2520in%2520seat.html">butt in seat</a>&quot; a non-starter. So, I'm kind of trying to abide and feel myself out. See if I can surf my own semi-uncontrollable hyperfocus and nudge it toward things I'd like to do in terms of higher-order life goals. But, I have utterly failed at simply steering myself at anything via main force of will.</p><p>I've managed functionality at dayjob tasks largely through expending what little influence I have - with lots of wheel spinning even still - and it seems that leaves me with little left over to decide anything optional at the end of the day. Just a floating pin on the I/O port fluctuating psuedo-randomly.
