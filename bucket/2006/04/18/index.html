                  <p>Between personal curiosity and research for a work project, I find myself with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/decafbad">a MySpace profile</a>.  The last time I really bothered to play the social self-disclosure game was for my <a href="http://deus-x.livejournal.com/profile">LiveJournal profile</a>, about 6 years ago.  I've done it with varying degrees of enthusiasm in other venues, but anymore I'm just tired of self-describing for social networking sites.  This is where FOAF starts looking good to me:  I just want to point each new profile - like my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/lmorchard">weak LinkedIn profile</a>, for example - at a master resource and autofill.  Of course, it doesn't help that visiting MySpace makes me throw up in my mouth a little, every time.</p>

                  <p>Also:  I'm considering a new MacBook Pro in the next year or so, and I'd like to take better care of it than I have this 40-month-old 867Mhz G4 PowerBook 12".  We have cats, so one of the nastiest things is that there's a micro-hairball woven under each keyboard scissor.  Does anyone have any experience with those silicone keyboard protectors?  Annoying?  Worth it?  Removal of the cats is not an option.</p>

                  <p>Ugh.  My poor little PowerBook has a few loose teeth on its keyboard.  Heavy use of various keys - as well as a botched attempt at cleaning awhile back - have left a few of the "scissor" mechanisms a bit injured.  I swapped some of these around to less important keys, but I'm debating ordering new parts.  And that's not to mention the half-dozen or so keys whose paint my fingers are wearing through.  Good thing I remember where A and S are.</p>

                  <p>One tough thing about taking screenshots for a book:  You've got to keep your asses and asshats out of the picture.  Bastards aren't considered welcome, either.</p>
