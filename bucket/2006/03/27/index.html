                  <p>As an aspiring writer, I have to say that I'm thoroughly enjoying the <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast/">Battlestar Galactica Podcast</a> - particularly <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast/mp3/writers_meeting/bsg_writersmeeting_pt1.mp3" title="bsg_writersmeeting_pt1.mp3">this episode recorded during a writers' meeting</a>, wherein I can hear them hashing out the details of an episode, what made it in and what didn't and why.  I really love absorbing the details and mechanics of the writing and creation process at work.</p>

                  <p>Ever since I was little, I've had the damnedest time making myself take naps even when I'm exhausted.  There's always so much to do, see, read and think.  I used to stay up until 2:00 AM every night, despite always getting up around 6:30 AM for work the next day.  When I <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/07/23/sleep_apnea">descended into sleep apnea and finally got treatment</a>, however, sleep became a sacred thing to me after having been denied it for too long.  So, now I go to bed much, much earlier.  Seems like earlier and earlier, these days.  Nonetheless, I still can't easily get myself to take mid-day naps.  When I finally sleep, it feels like I'm giving up on the day.  Yeah, I'm weird.</p>

                  <p>Another morning, still alive.  I came home from work last night, bumped into things at home for an hour or two, then crashed way early and slept for 9 hours.  I think I needed that.</p>
