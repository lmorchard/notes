                  <p>The last episode of the first installment of the <a hreef="http://www.bravemenrun.com/">Brave Men Run</a> fiction podcast just landed in my iTunes tonight.  The author / narrator expresses such a great deal of appreciation for his listeners, it makes me want to run over there and give him a standing ovation.  Even if I am the only guy doing it.  I really hope there's more coming in the <a hreef="http://www.bravemenrun.com/">Brave Men Run</a> story universe!</p>

                  <p>Of course, one thing I'd like to do this summer, maybe after the wedding, is to get some of my fiction ideas and half-starts finally fleshed out and in short story form.  Maybe I could do a podcast with some of those stories.</p>

                  <p>An ironic thing:  My decafbadNewsRIver aggregator is much more focused on blog entry titles than the standard NewsRiver.  This is because most of the feeds I read all follow the Title-Link-Description style of blogging.  But, now that I'm getting into this rapid-fire brain dump OPML blogging, many of the entries from the more recent additions to my reading lists are all completely without titles.  And now my aggregator looks weird.</p>
