                  <p>Sometimes, the writing flows and the wind is at my back.  I think finding ways to make that happen more reliably on command is one of the significant skills I need to pick up as I work on actually being a pro at this.  Because, when it works, I can really get in a zone - but when it doesn't, I can really get stuck.</p>

                  <p><a href="http://blogs.opml.org/amyloo/2006/03/07#cowskull">Amy</a>, I've often wondered about the cowskull myself.  I seem to remember knowing more about it at one time, but it's since slipped from my head.  It's got something about the cactus mojo in Frontier.  And, <a href="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/msg022177.html">Dave says</a>, "<i>You won't often see a cowskull sulking.</i>"</p>

                  <p>I've not done more than just barely view source on Ray Ozzie's <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/editorial/rayozzie/demo/liveclip/liveclipsample/clipboardexample.html">web clipboard demo</a>, but it has a really good smell about it.  Use microformats, seems like magic, works between browsers by way of my actual system clipboard on OS X.  I really need to look into this some more.</p>

                  <p>Er, what?!  There's a such thing as onCopy and onPaste JavaScript events for HTML form fields?  Get outta here!  Hmm, seems <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_Events#Microsoft-specific_events">Microsoft-specific</a>... and also <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/SafariJSProgTopics/Tasks/CopyAndPaste.html">in Safari</a>... and the demo worked for me on Firefox.  I wonder if this is just like AJAX - something Microsoft came up with that everyone else implemented because it was a good idea despite not being W3C-spec?  The plot thickens - for me, anyway.</p>

                  <p>Another hint about the web clipboard thing:  In Firefox, try selecting View > Page Style > No Style.  You can see more of the guts of the thing.</p>

                  <p>Busy day without blogging, but I still managed to be a blabber mouth on <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/opml2-review/messages">the OPML 2 review list</a>.  I think I need to quiet down for a bit and let some other people talk.</p>

                  <p>My verbosity stems from a personal desire to see this particular issue moved toward a resolution - hopefully my motor mouth helped provide a few points of clarity.  This crosses one of my favorite apps (<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/opml2-review/message/145">Tinderbox</a>) with what I think is one of the persistent grouse-points of OPML (<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/opml2-review/message/155">large amounts of text with line breaks in XML attributes</a>).</p>

                  <p>Personally, I think that the attributes issue is a non-issue, but it's one that needs a definitive FAQ answer at which to point.  Like <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/opml2-review/message/89">the RFC822 vs ISO8601 date format thing</a> - there are people who'll never be gut-happy with it, but I don't think it presents any real technical limitations.  There are <i>much</i> more interesting things to work on, once this one is put to bed.</p>
