                  <p><a href="http://blogs.opml.org/vacuum/2006/02/13#opmlEditorAndSpotlight">Ed says that OPML isn't caught by Spotlight on OS X.</a>  Hmm, I know how to make Spotlight plugins.  I should add that to my <a href="http://hosting.opml.org/decafbad/instantOutliner/l.m.orchard.opml">Maybe Do</a> list.</p>

                  <p>It'll take me awhile to get down to that Maybe Do list, though, since I've got book chapter deadlines as a steady drumbeat on through until mid-March that leave me just a sliver of time for side-hacking in the meantime.</p>

                  <p>Also, Ed: If you're still having trouble assigning links to blogroll items, I'm wondering if you've tried right-clicking / control-clicking on an outline node triangle?  There should be a context menu offering "Add Link..." as an option.  That'll spawn a dialog you can use to add or modify a URL associated with an outline node.</p>

                  <p>By the way, is anyone else back to using the Instant Outliner these days?  My <a href="http://hosting.opml.org/decafbad/instantOutliner/l.m.orchard.opml">IO is here</a>.  Apologies in advance though:  I'm still trying to work out quite what to use it for, or if the stuff there really belongs somewhere else.  I used to have an IO a few years ago, but drifted away from the habit.</p>

                  <p>Whenever I get a new gadget, no matter how low-powered, I try to <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/08/09/homebrew-productivity-via-rube-goldberg">wrap my brain around it</a> in a very real sense.  I try to explore the features and see how useful they can be as things I habitually reach for in the course of thought.  So, I've been having fun lately with a new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000BYEUUG/104-3738331-5415167?v=glance">LG PM-225</a> cameraphone from Sprint.  It's certainly no mega-nifty smartphone, but it's a hell of a step up from my trusty old <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/03/26/a500-not-3g">Samsung A500</a>.  A few initial thoughts:</p>
                  <ul data-parent-id="7">
          <li id="8" data-created="Tue, 14 Feb 2006 18:11:07 GMT">
                  <p>It's nice having a cameraphone, period, as well as having a much more capable web browser and SMS messaging built right into the phone (as opposed of accessible from web forms).</p>
                  
                </li><li id="9" data-created="Tue, 14 Feb 2006 18:17:33 GMT">
                  <p>I've installed <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/operamini/phones/?phone=lg_pm225">Opera Mini</a>, and started playing around with a <a href="http://decafbad.com/phone/feeds/">mobile reading list</a> of feeds using some code from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1">my first book</a>.</p>
                  
                </li><li id="10" data-created="Tue, 14 Feb 2006 18:17:42 GMT">
                  <p>It's been nice to skim some feeds and email myself links to items I'd like to read on a larger screen - which the built-in OpenWave browser does, but not Opera Mini.</p>
                  
                </li><li id="11" data-created="Tue, 14 Feb 2006 18:12:35 GMT">
                  <p>I've played just a bit with setting up some <a href="http://www.ii.com/internet/robots/procmail/">procmail filters</a> to route email from the phone to various folders or scripts.  For instance, I've got a notion to send myself captured thoughts and notes to be added to an <a href="http://support.opml.org/stories/storyReader$27">Instant Outline</a> hosted on my server and monitored from my PowerBook running the OPML Editor.</p>

                  <p>I've also been considering some homebrew moblogging tools for the camera side of things.</p>
