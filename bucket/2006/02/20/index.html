                  <p>Got <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/lmorchard/2006_2F02_2F19_23When_3A8_3A28_3A28PM/#2526">a nifty response from Todd Sieling of Ma.gnolia</a>, with respect to <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2006/02/19#When:8:28:28PM">my Ma.gnolia concerns</a>: <i>You can lay your suspicions to rest. We've been talking with these folks for quite a while both before and through beta, gauging interest and letting them know how social bookmarking can help them engage with their audiences in a new way that is more dynamic than a brochure website. Their appearance at launch was to make launch a bit more special. And, for what it's worth, alpha geeks haven't made up all the early members in Ma.gnolia. Designers, photographers and more casual web users have been part of the mix as well.</i></p>

                  <p>"<a href="http://www.sef.org.pk/educatewebsite/educate2fol/glosiconedu2.asp">Praxis</a> is a complex activity by which individuals create culture and society, and become critically conscious human beings. Praxis comprises a cycle of action-reflection-action which is central to liberatory education. Characteristics of praxis include self-determination (as opposed to coercion), intentionality (as opposed to reaction), creativity (as opposed to homogeneity), and rationality (as opposed to chance)."  (See also: <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Consolidated/_/Praxis">"Praxis" by Consolidated</a>, which is what got me googling for the term.)</p>

                  <p>I've got today off from work, but that doesn't mean I'm not working.  I'm hoping to get a dozen or so pages ahead on the current chapter, maybe even get this one done early.  I'm about 3/4 through with drafts, so here's hoping that I'll have the whole thing wrapped up by April!</p>
