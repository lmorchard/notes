                  <p>A couple of years ago, I said <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/03/put-on-your-rss-colored-glasses-and-forget-about-atom">"Put on your RSS-colored glasses and forget about Atom</a>."  (Wow, has it been that long?)  Well, right now I'm saying this:  Put on your XOXO-colored glasses and forget about OPML.</p>

                  <p>Here's an outline snagged from my OPML blog today:</p>

                  <p>Now, here's that outline in some semblance of XOXO:</p>

                  <p>Here's the XSLT that I used to transform from OPML to XOXO:</p>

                  <p>And, here's the mod_rewrite chicanery I threw together to facilitate this:</p>
                  <ul data-parent-id="9">
          <li id="10" data-created="Fri, 17 Feb 2006 04:22:06 GMT">

                  <p>I think my XSLT could use some work to better conform to XOXO, and I still need to find a non-CGI-based URL-line XSLT processor for around here, but this seems like it might be a way to provide XOXO-colored glasses to visitors who don't like the cut of my OPML.  Does anyone have an RDF-based outline format for me to use?  I could throw that in, too.</p>

                  <p>I was chatting briefly with <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/vacuum/">Ed</a> last night about chatbots and Jabber.  And, apropos my recent enthusiasm for the OPML Editor platform, it's just come back to me:  <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/tcpIm">Frontier and Radio UserLand have support for instant messaging via AIM and Jabber</a>.  I wonder how up-to-date that support is in the OPML Editor?  It's like 2002 all over again.</p>

          <li id="15" data-created="Thu, 16 Feb 2006 15:39:15 GMT">
                  <p>The OPML Editor has now supplanted both <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> and <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">Ecto</a> for idea management and publishing on my PowerBook.  Speaking as <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2006/02/14#When:3:17:36PM">an avowed neophile</a>, who knows if this will be a permanent change, but it's looking pretty interesting so far.</p>

                  <p>I'm wondering if I'll miss the more advanced visualization tools in Tinderbox.  I never quite got into the export features, beyond converting my notes into XOXO and OPML.  And, I always stopped short of truly "living" within the powerful agents and structured data facilities of Tinderbox.  I'm not sure if it was a reluctance to develop a dependency on something not Open Source, or what.  Tinderbox is nonetheless a powerful and rich tool.</p>
                  
                </li><li id="17" data-created="Thu, 16 Feb 2006 15:46:15 GMT">
                  <p>And as for Ecto, it has wonderful features for managing existing entries and has a great preview window - but I can publish to my OPML blog so fast that I never need preview, and I if I actually need to manage existing entries I can either edit the OPML or go to my WordPress administration screens.</p>
                  
                </li><li id="18" data-created="Thu, 16 Feb 2006 16:21:45 GMT">
                  <p>I also realize that I never quite "lived" in Radio UserLand, back when I was heavily using it.  I never did much with outlines in it, mostly using it as a news aggregator and a quirky hacking environment.  Not that the same parts are cobbled together as an idea management and publishing system called OPML Editor, the perspective changes a bit for me.</p>

                  <p><a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/02/16.html#When:9:27:52AM">Dave says</a>: "I'm starting to get a new release of the OPML Editor together, as part of the release I asked Andre Radke to prepare a download for the kernel source. The OPML Editor is an open source app, licensed under the GPL."</p>

                  <p>I can certainly <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2006/02/13#When:7:59:00PM">attest to the fact that the OPML Editor is Open Source</a>, and not vapor or a mirage of any kind.  In fact, I'm writing this on version 10.1a6 that I compiled myself with Apple's Xcode from a SourceForge CVS check-out.  It's a serious effort to have made it this easy.  I didn't have to tweak or coax anything - I just clicked on the Build hammer.</p>

                  <p>And, to expand on what I said earlier this week:  The OPML Editor and <a href="http://frontierkernel.sourceforge.net/">Frontier Kernel</a> is an Open Source release of a project with a decade or more of legacy as a commercial product - yet, it still compiles into a useful application and runs without much fuss.  That was the big thing that Mozilla missed when it was first released as Open Source.  This is exciting stuff and a hard thing to have accomplished, me thinks.</p>

                  <p>A few years ago, maybe back around 1998, I lost my college class ring at a KMFDM/PIG concert in Detroit.  I was sweaty, there were bodies slamming around, I was pushing bodies away from me, and after one push my ring was gone.  Crap.  Yesterday, though, I received the ring in a package.  Someone had found it after the concert back then and was finally able to find me online to tell me about it.  How's that for cool?</p>
