                  <p><a href="http://blogs.opml.org/dwatts/2006/02/15#When:5:00:28PM">Donovan points me toward</a> an <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/spaziopml/2005/08/12#presentingaPresentationTool">OPML Editor tool</a> that helps build <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">S5</a> presentations from OPML documents, rendered via an XSLT transformation to XOXO that includes all the <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">S5</a> machinery.  Presentations straight from outlines, with web standards goodness.  Who says you can't have cake and eat it too?</p>

                  <p>Later:  Hot damn, it's my <a href="http://hosting.opml.org/decafbad/l.m.orchard.xml">Instant Outline as an S5 presentation</a>.  No, it doesn't make a ton of sense, but it was quick and easy to make this nonsense.</p>

                  <p><a href="http://blogs.opml.org/dwatts/2006/02/15#When:4:55:09PM">Donovan's also getting an odd error</a> from my newsRiver add-on, and the original NewsRiver.  I hope my crud didn't break things, though.  Not sure if this tip helps, but:  You can try running <kbd>viewNewsItems</kbd> in decafbadNewsRiverSuite directly within the OPML editor to "replay" the last web request and get an in-editor error dialog with a more helpful Go To button to chase the error.</p>

                  <p>I'm starting to think that the OPML Editor and NewsRiver is a good platform to try throwing together a next iteration of my <a href="http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/hacking_rss_and_atom/ch15_popular_links.py">popular links script</a> and some notions I had in mind for <a href="http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool">FeedSpool</a>.  I still really like some of the ideas I was exploring with <a href="http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedSpool">FeedSpool</a> - but apropos <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/13/reading-lists-opml-xoxo-semantic-web-and-tools">my recent semi-rant about tools</a>, I should target efforts where more people can take advantage of them more easily.  I love Python, and definitely have a yen for things running on the OS itself - rather than the OS-within-an-OS that is the OPML Editor.  But, I haven't yet had time to bundle my stuff up as a single-icon install like the OPML Editor, and there's a lot of infrastructure already there for the hacking.  So, if you can't beat 'em...</p>

                  <p>I'd also like to get back around to adding more things to <a href="http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedMagick">FeedMagick</a>, such as maybe some Reading List style features to blend multiple feeds from an OPML list into one output feed.  Need to build some cross-format conversion tools.  I could also see a popular links type script joining <a href="http://decafbad.com/2005/12/FeedMagick/">the suite</a>.  These sorts of things seem like they could be a server-side complement to the OPML Editor, especially in cases where I can't run Frontier or the OPML Editor on a server yet PHP is available.</p>

                  <p>Hey <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/yabfog/2006/02/15#When:10:19:13AM">Dan</a>, I can't keep up with most of my ideas either - especially with a day like today that had hours of back-to-back meetings.  I've just been <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2006/02/12#lightningFastBloggingWithTheOpmlEditor">suddenly getting better at spewing things out of my head</a>.  But I figure if I can get even just a few of them done, I'm in good shape.  Otherwise, I hope someone steals the ideas I don't get around to.  And, yeah, I pretty much do try to stay wired all the time.  ";->"</p>

                  <p>I got an email from Jesse Graffam from over at <a href="http://www.radioio.com/">radioio</a>, telling me about <a href="http://www.radioio.com/radioio90s.php">their new 90's station</a>.  I was all like, "Man, a 90's station?  That's starting to make me feel old-- hey, look at all the cool album covers!"</p>

                  <p>Ever since I became a <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> convert, my fingers keep hitting <kbd>svn</kbd> even when I really <i>do</i> mean <kbd>cvs</kbd>.  I had to try three times to get the right command, the last time I checked something out from SourceForge.  And even then, I was rewarded with the usual "update aborted" I get from the overloaded SF CVS servers, but that's another story.</p>
