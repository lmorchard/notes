                  <p>More rationale behind why I want to eventually see <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2006/02/17#When:8:23:38PM">XSLT support</a> revived and working for the OPML Editor:</p>

                  <p>I figure pretty much all the gripes I've had with OPML as a format are eased by the fun I'm having with the Editor, and can be <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/16/just-put-on-your-xoxo-colored-glasses">further ameliorated by XSLT-powered conversions</a>.  If XSLT were built into the OPML Editor, other formats could be as close as a Save As.  Of course, UserTalk scripts to save in other formats are possible as well - but XSLT can live a life outside the Editor, say, on PHP-powered servers.</p>

                  <p>I wrote an <a href="http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XSLScraper">XSLT-based RSS/Atom feed scraper</a> that I think would make a good companion to the NewsRiver tool, if it could run on the same platform.</p>

                  <p>I suppose, as a mockup, I could start stubbing out some XSLT scripts that use <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/05/xslt">the W3C XSLT servlet</a> or a PHP script on my server to perform the transformations until an updated DLL is available.</p>

                  <p>I know I've initiated a slew of potential projects since I began playing with the OPML Editor, though I won't be able to do much in depth for a little while.  I'm mostly queueing up work for myself after I finish this book, and hoping that a few of these leads get stolen by others with more time on their hands.  ";->"  Think of it as public brainstorming or doodles.</p>

                  <p>Although, I do worry sometimes that there might be a few people out there who think I'm going off some manic deep end with all this sudden blogging activity.  But really, this is the sort of thing that runs through my head a lot of the time, but it tends to evaporate or disappear onto post-its I lose shortly thereafter.  It's like quantum mental foam, might amount to vacuum nothing or it might collapse into something material.  I don't think that metaphor's quite right - but anyway, it's just been too easy to spew notions into published outline nodes, so I've been going with it.  In the meantime, I hope my enthusiasm is entertaining at least.</p>

                  <p>That said, here's another notion:  I wonder how the OPML Editor could be used to help facilitate <a href="http://www.structuredblogging.org/formats.php">Structured Blogging</a>?</p>

                  <p>Here's something I just stumbled upon:  I've seen some people wondering just what gets updated after getting the latest code for the OPML Editor.  Well, if you jump to <code>user.rootUpdates.prefs</code> and set <code>flShowUpdatesToUser</code> to <code>true</code>, you'll start seeing granular update reports.  I don't think this breaks anything, but I haven't dug deep enough to be sure.  Also, the messages are a bit cryptic if you're not familiar with the ODB structure.  So, as usual, know that Here Be Dragons.</p>

                  <p>On introducing people to blogging, <a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/02/24.html#bloggingForNewbies">Dave wrote</a>:</p>

                  <p><i>Then someday, when you're in the shower or lying in bed in the morning and get an idea that you wish you could tell everyone, remember that you have a blog, and go to the computer, and write it up and publish it. That actually feels pretty good, even if you think no one will read it, because you got it off your chest.</i></p>
                  
                </li><li id="15" data-created="">
                  <p><i>Then in a few days Google will probably visit your site and index the post, and then when someone searches for that subject, your page will come up, and maybe you'll pass that idea on to someone who can use it, or meet someone who agrees, or someone who disagrees. And that's blogging, and that's all it is.</i></p>
