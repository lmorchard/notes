                  <p>Along the lines of <a href="http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/2006/02/17/are-we-held-hostage-by-yahoos-acquisitions/#c1098837">this not-so-nice comment</a> I left over on the Social Software Weblog, I've been considering some add-ons to a Scuttle install that would broadcast and copy bookmarks out to various other services via their respective APIs.  I could channel all my daily bookmarking habits into an install of Scuttle on the server in my basement and CC: all the other places where I have bookmarking accounts - thereby remaining in possession of my data whilst still participating in the other services.  Seems like it might be a bit of a wrongheaded idea, though.</p>

                  <p>Heh, heh - looks like I got <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/25/podcasts-i-like-lately#comment-6111">a response from Dr. Steve</a> to my mini-review of <a href="http://doctorfloyd.com/">The Radio Adventures of Doctor Floyd</a>.  Very cool - and, of course, I only listen to cheer for the masterminded schemes of Dr. Steve.  Oh, and to try to figure out what Fidgert's saying.</p>

                  <p>Modular HTML system with initial support for switchable themes via <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5337/decafbadNewsRiver/prefs">prefs</a>.  For nerdy styling fun, take a jump to this location after installation:</p>

                  <p>The new default theme uses the <a href="http://radio.userland.com/developer/APIs/aggregatorApi">Aggregator API</a> built into NewsRiver to enable AJAX-style per-item and per-feed deletion, as well as deferred loading of news item text until the item node is expanded.  (It also requires that you've set a username and password for the API in the prefs, and uses a very nasty and insecure hack to get at that username and password.  Suggestions welcome!)</p>

                  <p>Note that this add-on does not <i>replace</i> your existing NewsRiver installation, and you'll need to visit <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5337/decafbadNewsRiver">/decafbadNewsRiver</a> on your local OPML Editor web server to see the new stuff.  And, while deleting items and such from this new view <i>does</i> delete the same items shown in NewsRiver, this tool tries to otherwise be as non-destructive to NewsRiver data as possible.</p>

                  <p>Hmm.  I just added a new feature to decafbadNewsRiver that uses the Aggregator API to defer loading of news item text, but it looks like the updater code is somehow funked up now when I try to update on my "production" machine after publishing from my "dev" machine.  The dev machine goes into a 100% CPU consumption death spiral.  Unfortunately, the updater code is 90% voodoo to me and entirely unrelated to how code gets updated elsewhere in the OPML Editor, so at this moment all I do is shrug and go to bed.</p>
