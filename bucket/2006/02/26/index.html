                  <p>Lisa Williams points to <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/thisislisa/2006/02/26#offlineEditorsAreFromMarsTheOpmlEditorIsFromVenus">OPML blogging bewilderment</a> from authors of a desktop blogging client, <a href="http://qumana.com/">Qumana</a>.  <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2006/02/12#lightningFastBloggingWithTheOpmlEditor">I compared the OPML Editor to a cavitating torpedo.</a>  It's just fast and uncomplicated - it's light on formatting features, but that itself is a feature.  I type, and save, and I'm published.  I could post 60 entries in a minute, maybe more.  (I type pretty fast, think faster.)  When I open the day's outline, I'm not Faced with the Task of Composing a Document, I'm faced with a structure based on luring atomic thoughts out of my head.  Ready, fire, aim.  That's the blogging style here.</p>

                  <p>I come back here later; I can post another entry; move it around; expand on an idea; restructure atomic ideas into a molecule of a larger entry.  The day's context and history remain splayed out for my perusal.  The day is a fine unit of continuity for a run of thought.  Further on through the course of thought, I can move into a richer tool if I feel I've got enough from which to Compose a Document - but until then, at least I haven't wedged the mechanisms.  I've gotten it out of my head.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gtd" title="GTD rests on the principle that you have to get things out of your head and recorded into a system you can trust.">Getting Things Done, blogger style</a>.</p>

                  <p>Since I started playing with this tool for blogging, I'll bet that I've gotten more out of my head and onto the web in just over two weeks than I have in the past six months.  <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/03/26/oooofa">This has been a theme in my blogging for quite some time now.</a>  So, you can probably imagine why finding what looks like a solution to the problem has induced such enthusiasm in me.</p>

                  <p>Oh yeah, in case anyone wonders:  People (including you) can call me Les.  My search term for google-juice l.m.orchard, and my personal brand-name is 0xDECAFBAD.  Occasionally, my user name is deusx, deusx23, lmorchard, or lorchard.  It's all kind of weird and confusing sometimes, but all these monikers make for easier disambiguated ego-searching in the tuple space, usually.  Some of these are artifacts of my past attempts at being a cool kid.  ";->"</p>

                  <p>There's nothing like writing a book to wring free every last drop of interest one has in a topic.  After finishing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597582/0xdecafbad01-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&adid=0M02HP2XHWA8JD62MBN3&link_code=as1">Hacking RSS and Atom</a>, I didn't want to think about or touch anything syndication feed related ever again.  Of course, my reservoirs of interest have since self-replenished, and I expect the same will happen with respect to <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/14/hacking-delicious-is-a-real-book">my thoughts on del.icio.us</a>.</p>

                  <p>At this point, I feel like just about every fractal neural branching of my brain on this subject has been roughly extracted and aspirated clean from my cranial cavity.  If you can believe it, all this public brainstorming I've been doing with the OPML Editor has really been akin to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_injection_(oil_production)">water injection in oil fields</a>, so that my brain doesn't collapse in upon itself from the vacuum left behind.  (The main difference being that the OPML injection itself is worth recovering once I've gotten all the del.icio.us out of there in a few weeks.)</p>
