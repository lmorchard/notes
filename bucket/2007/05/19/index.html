                  <p><a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2005/10/reading_lists_f.html">OPML-based reading lists</a> seem to be a feature that hasn't gotten picked up by any of the major aggregators other than Dave Winer's <a href="http://opmlwiki.bbcity.co.uk/index.php?title=NewsRiver">NewsRiver</a>.  That's kinda sad to me, because I think a meta-subscription to a curated list of feeds is a brilliant idea.  Just doing a one-time import of a reading list isn't good enough - the over-head light bulb comes on when the reading list gets changed on a regular basis by the curator, rotating feeds over time.</p>

Enter a search term and click the 'make monitor.opml' button to get a list of rss feeds in OPML format."</p>

                  <p>Looks like I need to get back to poking at <a href="http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedMagick">FeedMagick</a> and write that OPML reading list powered feed blender module I've been thinking about.  Pass in the URL to an OPML file listing feeds, get one mixed feed back.</p>

                  <p>I wonder if it would be interesting and not-too-difficult to have a hook in the OPML Editor to blog and render from the local machine straight to an Amazon S3 bucket?</p>

                  <p><a href="http://www.starcraft2.com/">StarCraft II</a>.  Hot damn.  I've just recently been playing through the original StarCraft, slowly getting my RTS groove back on.  It's been awhile since last I really played any strategy games like that.  They've really gotten the balance perfect in StarCraft.  The game has lasted this long because it's more of an automated board game than a video game, and a friend at work described it as "one great big collection of paper-rock-scissors matches," where various units trump other units fairly reliably.  Trying to understand it feels a lot like when I started learning to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(board_game)">Go</a> - but that might just be me.</p>
