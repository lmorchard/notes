                  <p>Thinking of building a Facebook platform app.  It would be a free, cruddy version of the "<a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2234372130">gifts</a>" offered on the site.  Instead of cute icons and pleasant surprises, you could send rusty nails and moldy hams.  Maybe a splintered chopstick.</p>

                  <p>Oh, doom, doom, doom.  <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/05/30itunesplus.html">Apple launches iTunes Plus</a>, which sells DRM-free tracks.  Now I'll find it so much harder to squash impulse buys of music due to DRM lockdown.  I haven't bought a thing from iTunes since about 6 months after the store opened, thanks to that.  But now...  Oh, I'm in trouble now.</p>

                  <p>That reminds me:  I have a server.  I also have an S3 account.  I need to put files there and back things up on a regular basis.</p>

                  <p>Intrigued by Palm's new <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/mobilecompanion/foleo/">Foleo</a>, but it's mostly just got me hoping that Apple comes out with a rumored / wished-for <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/03/14/intel_introduces_first_solid_state_drives_based_on_flash_memory.html">tiny solid-state notebook</a>.</p>

                  <p>Oh yeah, and all this offline / local web app and DB-on-the-desktop stuff?  As <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/05/30/googleGears.html">Dave Winer mentions</a>, it's not totally new - though renewed interest / uptake might do odd and wonderful things with the concept now.  Personally, I've been interested in <a href="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/04/desktopWebsites.html#4">desktop websites</a> since before the days of <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio UserLand 8</a> and around the time of <a href="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html">Fractional Horsepower HTTP Servers</a>.</p>

                  <p>And, of course, <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gears/">Google Gears</a> has piqued my interest as well.  Poking around with offline web apps has been on my round tuit list since <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/">Brad Neuberg</a> first clued me in about his <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/offline">Dojo Offline Toolkit</a> in the works.  Seems like there's something brewing here, and I'll probably wish I had lots of offline apps when I'm on the plane to the UK next month.</p>

                  <p>My ears definitely perked up when I read that <a href="http://www.mikechambers.com/blog/2007/05/30/apollo-beta-will-include-sqlite-embedded-database/">Apollo will include SQLite</a>.  Maybe I'll finally build a Flash-based news aggregator <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/19/flash-agg">like I've thought about for years</a>.  You know, for me, every new platform gets interesting when I can conceivably build a news aggregator with it.  :)  Kind of a mutant cousin to <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Z/Zawinskis-Law.html">Zawinski's Law</a>.</p>

                  <p>Also, thinking more favorable thoughts <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2007/05/25#When:11:02:29AM">than last week</a> about the new Facebook platform.  Having a great amount of social network fatigue, I find it hard to get enthused about yet another one at all - popularity notwithstanding.  But, having done my own "hello world" app, perused the docs, and poked around the edges - I have to say that this looks like a promising way to add self-hosted guest rooms onto their walled garden.  And without weird and barely tolerated hacks, ala MySpace.  It's the reverse of inside-out mashups via public APIs - <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/documentation.php">but they've got those too</a>.  It's not necessarily either-or.  If your audience includes people who (unlike me) are living on / through Facebook, this is a good way to loop your app more easily into their routine.</p>

                  <p>Not sure what to think about <a href="http://blog.last.fm/2007/05/30/lastfm-acquired-by-cbs">CBS buying last.fm</a>.  It makes me wonder for how much longer I'll have that <a href="http://www.last.fm/group/iScrobbler">iScrobbler</a> icon in my menu bar.</p>
