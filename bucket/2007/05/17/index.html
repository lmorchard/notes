                  <p><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com.nyud.net:8080/blog/2007/05/16/how-scoble-reads-622-rss-feeds-each-morning/">How Scoble Reads 622 RSS Feeds Each Morning</a>.  I like this over-the-shoulder video.  A lot of the reactions I've seen to it <a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/How_Scoble_Reads_622_RSS_Feeds_Each_Morning">from digg</a> and elsewhere are of the "get a life!" or "what a dweeb!" variety.  But, again, this ain't for them.  Some people - like me, with my 500+ feed habit - like to see how other infovores work and like being this connected to information.  Scoble has his Google Reader shared items feed, I've got <a href="http://del.icio.us/deusx">my del.icio.us bookmarks</a> (up to 9012 as of this writing).</p>

                  <p>To read <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/yahoo/corporate-branding-gone-awry-261379.php">this from Valleywag</a> and <a href="http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-9719557-7.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20">this (albeit not as catty) from CNET</a>, you'd think the mind-control rays would be saturating my cube in a sickly purple/yellow glow from the ceiling mounted wifi access points on a daily basis here at Yahoo!  Fact is, the purple-and-yellow-everywhere thing has been here for quite a long while - it's not amazing and new.  Google's got their thing going on too.  So do a lot of other companies.  The rah-rah mission statement thing, too.  They're really reaching over at Valleywag.</p>

                  <p>On the other hand: The mind-control rays must have a retroactive effect, because purple's actually been my favorite color since I was little.  I like the overabundant access to purple sharpies.</p>

                  <p>This bit about <a href="http://www.mochikit.com/">MochiKit</a> makes me a tad sad.  Before I got fully <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a>-ified, <a href="http://www.mochikit.com/">MochiKit</a> was my favorite <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/12/09/mochis-basic">Simons Basic cartridge</a> for the web.  It's not like it went anywhere, and the above-linked discussion thread appears to show that the kit's still in production use, but the folks involved are just too busy actually <i>using</i> the thing to do releases for the world.  (Which is, of course, largely a thankless task I'd imagine.)</p>

                  <p>Good morning.  I wish that whomever had discovered coffee had been enshrined in myths and legends throughout time, perhaps as some sort of cousin to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus">Prometheus</a> in some Mediterranean versions of the tale.  I hear it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee#History">discovered in Ethiopia</a> by a goatherd - that seems to have some potential for story.</p>
