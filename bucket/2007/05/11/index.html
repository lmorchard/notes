                  <p>Feeling like I've run out of people points today.  Had promised to go to a party tonight, but just feeling out of gas.  Sometimes, I wish I were an extrovert, but I'm an introvert through and through.</p>

As for the rest of the world, I'm slowly learning how to balance and trying to figure out how to throw myself at the world strategically.</p>

                  <p>Thinking I need to set up some writing prompts for myself and schedule something to ping me with them.  I'd like to get to a point where I write at least one thing a day.  For example: reviews of podcasts - I listen to a dozen or so, and should probably drop a mention of the ones I'm really hot on, if only to throw some link-juice their way.</p>

                  <p>In July, I'll have been in California for a year.  It's been a doozy of a year, too.  I should definitely write a year-in-review thing.  Include some answers to my questions from a year ago, from future-self to past-self and coincidentally any kindred like-selves out there making a similar move.</p>

                  <p>I also have some topics brewing in my head that I just never seem to compose into essay or even tumble-log form.  For example: y'know, I'm actually doing not too badly at turning into what I wanted to be when I grew up - and I'm pretty damn happy about that.  Furthermore, I'm starting to get an idea of what I'll be like as I get older and older, and I think I'll be a pretty cool old guy someday.  It's pretty nice knowing that your past-self would've liked your now-self, and your now-self will probably look up to your future-self.</p>

                  <p>Oh, and although it should be obvious to everyone but less clueful "blogs are boring" journalists, I'd also like to write something about how all this writing and blogging is as much (or more) for me than it is for various values of "you" as reader.  I often find my own stuff in web searches, and it's often what I was looking for.  :)</p>
