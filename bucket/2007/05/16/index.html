                  <p>Just back from watching Serenity on HD DVD at a friend / co-worker's house.  Man, having been a luddite about HDTV for so long, I can finally appreciate the difference.</p>

                  <p>Chances are good that I'll be attending the <a href="http://hackday.org/">Yahoo! Hack Day in London</a> on June 16th & 17th to offer some <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> representation.  Thanks to my <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/18/just-call-me-crash">klutzy bus exit last September</a>, I missed the Hack Day in Sunnyvale with Beck - hopefully a trip to the UK will ameliorate my regret in missing that event.  Now, since I never managed to get one up till now, I need to see about getting a passport in the next 3 weeks.</p>

                  <p>1768 unread feed items for me in Vienna.  It's a light day - I'll have skimmed through these and more before bed.  Hopefully, getting back to a lighterweight approach to blogging will get me babbling more about what I'm reading.</p>

                  <p>For Scott, Twitter probably <i>is</i> pointless at first glance.  And that's because no one's talking to him.  Really, this should be a FAQ for all social media, to be read by all journalists and commentators:  Listening in on random strangers' conversations is more likely to be boring than not, and that's what you're doing if you just go to <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter.com</a> and start clicking around.  But, to assume because <i>you're</i> bored that the service as a <i>whole</i> is boring is, again, to be one of the <a href="http://www.noogenesis.com/pineapple/blind_men_elephant.html">Blind Men with an Elephant</a>.</p>

                  <p>Twitter becomes immensely interesting when it turns out that you've amassed a group of contacts who tend to run in similar circles as you, because even their off-handed remarks and random burps have a decent chance of surfacing something interesting or entertaining.  When it's good, this sets up a nice ambient chatter like sitting in a coffee shop filled with just your kind of people.</p>
                  
                </li><li id="8" data-created="Wed, 16 May 2007 18:25:00 GMT">
                  <p>This same "I'm bored, so it's boring" mistake has popped up again and again - applied to blogging, MMORPGs, social bookmarking, MySpace, what have you.  Replace "bored/boring" with "confused/confusing" or "annoyed/annoying" and you've got my own early reactions to MySpace.</p>

                  <p>But, really, it's not <i>addressed to you</i> if there's a buzz and you're not groking it.  That's a clue that you're probably missing something.  Granted, people can be insane, but it really is more likely that you're missing something - even if it's just that there's a particular brand of entertaining insanity in progress to which you're not attuned.</p>

                  <p>I love that on <a href="http://planetretcon.com/index.php?p=SGC">The Stargate Cafï¿½</a>, a sci-fi sitcom podcast, they use "pod" and "blog" as profanity-substitutes for "god" and "damn".  POD-BLOGGIT!</p>

                  <p>I've got a set of semi-private feeds running that show me site metrics like recent referers.  It's cool to see them light up with links and newsreaders when I actually start posting again.  :)</p>

                  <p>Seeing as I've started playing Starcraft and Warcraft III for the first time - already having gotten sucked into WoW - I think <a href="http://blizzard.com/">Blizzard's</a> latest time-line teaser and the rumors of a new sequel / franchise are just a clever marketing campaign to bump sales of all their other games.  Damn, they're good.</p>

                  <p>And, since there are 2 more titles left to light up before the big ole question mark - does that mean they're going to drag us out for another few days, or do a two-fer reveal on Thursday and make the big announcement on Friday?</p>
