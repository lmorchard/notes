                  <p>Is it just me, or have all of the recent anti-marijuana commercials in the US seemed like the sort of thing one might come up with while partaking?  And, I have to be honest, they seem pretty goofy and don't actually me think ill of the stuff.</p>

                  <p>Speaking of geeky and gawky, I'm still sort of working how this whole tumble / OPML blogging thing works in terms of published thought order.  Do I post in reverse-chonological order?  Sometimes it makes sense to read the day as a whole in narrative sequence.  Sometimes it makes sense to tail a log.  This is a little different than "normal" blogging.</p>

                  <p>I like how <a href="http://anarchaia.org/">Christian Neukirchen's Anarchaia</a> tumbles out a day-at-a-time on the feeds.  I wonder if an option like that for this blog would be good?  Something a little more "published" and a little less fluxxy than a direct view on my mental foam.</p>

The only way to get something to stick is to put up a compelling app, and let the market drive a standard. Tech people don't play nice unless the market forces them to."</p>

                  <p>Catching some of Dave's buzz about a new cobbling-together of technologies.  It's fun to watch him start spinning up on an idea.  This time, it's Twitter and little MP3s.  Not sure if <a href="http://www.twittergram.com/">TwitterGrams</a> will take off, but podcasting <a href="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/11/payloadsForRss.html">looked like this</a> at one point.</p>

                  <p>Still in a bit of a creative / hacking slump, but I wonder if it would be fun to lash something together out of some scripting, some S3, some Twitter API, and some other bits and bobs?  Could be like a real ambient stream of <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2007/05/16#damnKidsGetOffMyWeb">coffee-shop background chatter</a>.  I wonder if it would be annoying or strangely engaging?  Text is easy to do at work, audio's harder.  Hmm.</p>

                  <p>I remember in part of <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5160442894955175707">Joi Ito's 23C3 presentation on World of Warcraft</a> that he mentioned he sometimes leaves the We Know guild TeamSpeak channel streaming into his house speakers in the background, even when he's not playing.  At the time, I was reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbows_End">Vernor Vinge's <i>Rainbows End</i></a>, which has lots of scenes of near-future internetworked human collaboration and lots of ambient presence through wearables.</p>

                  <p>It's all kind of geeky and gawky right now, where things exist or work at all.  But, I remember when <i>I</i> was really gawky - and am less so now.  I'm even more geeky, but I like to think I've matured.  Hopefully this stuff all will too.</p>
