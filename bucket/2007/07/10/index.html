                  <p>Hello world.  Going to be sleeping at <a href="http://www.caminomedical.org/sleep/">a clinic</a> tonight for my first sleep apnea re-test in years.  This should be interesting.</p>

                  <p>Trying something slightly in writing here different today - going to try to arrange outline notes in some top-down narrative order.  So, if you start from "Hello world" at the beginning of the day and read down, it should at least make sense as a ramble across the day.</p>

                  <p>Hmm, I've got most of the parts - in rough form - to build <a href="http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner">a browser-based outliner</a> that <a href="http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/XoxoOutliner/js/myXMLRPC.js">speaks XML-RPC via AJAX</a> back to an OPML Community Server.  I wonder if I could finish it and make it work?  And I wonder if it would work on an iPhone?  Hmm, it uses a lot of keyboard shortcuts - I wonder how the touch interface could translate to browser events and a useful outlining environment?</p>

                  <p>I guess Jakob Neilsen would not approve of this short-form blog.  The funny thing is, I tend to think that given limited time, I won't often cross the threshold toward writing articles.  Thus, if I limited myself to that, then nothing would get from my head to the web.  I'll stay quiet, as I've demonstrated throughout the past few years.  I suppose if my rambings here are annoying, that might be a good thing.  But, I have found some value to just floating a stream of small thought bubbles, any one of which might expand into something bigger when they run into others'.</p>

                  <p>More random web framework thoughts:  It actually surprises me that PHP 5 is so low in adoption as to require a <a href="http://gophp5.org/">Go PHP 5</a> campaign.  The more I think about it, I wonder if an insistence on PHP 5 actually wrecks the idea of "runs where WordPress does" for all practical purposes?  And, if that idea's wrecked - would the bar for installing something like a Django app be significantly higher?  Because, really, ubiquity is <i>the</i> single reason I'm even bothering with PHP.  But that tolerance is thin enough that I'm not willing to put up with PHP 4.  Life's too short.</p>
