                  <p>Hello world.  I'm exhausted - slept in the clinic last night, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/wires/">covered in wires</a>.  To get a good natural reading from me they kept me off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAP">CPAP</a> for half the night, so that was a disaster in terms of actual rest.  I think I got about 2 or 3 actual hours' sleep once they put me back on the breathing machine.  Woke up with a raw throat, a nasty limpy leg cramp, and a seriously cranky mood.  Hoping I'll at least be somewhat productive today.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/776293449/">Serious business</a>, this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea">sleep apnea</a>.</p>

                  <p>One side effect of Yahoo! Photos closing and my choosing to migrate to Flickr: I rediscovered <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/deusx/658235578/in/set-72157600546973928/">the photo I used in a Yahoo! Personals ad</a> through which my wife first found me.  Found, with the intention to mock, that is.</p>

                  <p>Funny how long I've had a Yahoo! login ID.  I'd guess it's been almost 10 years.  I wonder where I might find that signup date?</p>

                  <p>It's too bad that the iPhone's BlueTooth is limited to headsets.  A <a href="http://www.frogpad.com/information/bluefroginfo.asp">BlueTooth iFrog</a> might be nice to use with it, maybe even an <a href="http://www.frogpad.com/information/iFrogWearable.asp">iFrog wearable</a>.</p>

                  <p>I wouldn't say I'm in love with PHP - quite the opposite.  It's just that it seems to have won the war so far in hosting penetration.  I've had dalliances with Twisted over the past few years - and though I do dig quite a lot about it, it seems to have quite a high bar for adoption.  (Keep in mind I've been considering WordPress as a role model.)</p>

                  <p>The more I think about the Zend Framework, the less I think I'm actually all that enamored with it.  The docs need work, some bits seem missing or clunky, and I catch small hints here and there that there's a bit of flutter in the consistency of the framework's development process and goals.  One funny thing, though, is that there's a Zend office almost within walking distance of our apartment.  I wonder if I could walk down there and have a chat about things?  :)</p>
