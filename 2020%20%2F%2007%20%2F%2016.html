</p></blockquote><p>I thought this was rather by design? Conservatives really like to line the chute with knives &amp; broken glass to herd people onto the virtuous path. How could we possibly spur workers on to greater toil if there's some possibility that they could complacently afford to live? And how can we prove the point if a few workers aren't seen walking through the glass and falling on the knives by obviously failing at living?</p>
