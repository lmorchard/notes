The modern notion of a REST API has historical links to Fielding’s REST architecture, but really the two things are separate. The historical link is good to keep in mind as a guide for when to build a RESTful API. Does your API cross organizational and national boundaries the same way that HTTP needs to? Then building a RESTful API with a predictable, uniform interface might be the right approach. If not, it’s good to remember that Fielding favored having form follow function. Maybe something like <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="GraphQL.html">GraphQL</a> or even just JSON-RPC would be a better fit for what you are trying to accomplish.&quot;</li></ul></li></ul>
