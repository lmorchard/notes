						<p>Hello world.</p><p>I keep meaning to write more here on a daily basis again. Serial enthusiasm and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="my%2520brain%2520is%2520a%2520pen%2520plotter%2520drawing%2520unoptimized%2520paths.html">my brain is a pen plotter drawing unoptimized paths</a> has me wandering off.</p><p>An irony is that I was starting each of these entries out with &quot;Hello world.&quot; as a way to start with <em>something</em> as an ice breaker - but then I felt bad when the day's entry ended up on the web with solely that text. So then I just re-imposed the stop energy of not writing anything unless I had something to write.</p><p>Also have a notion to rework an RSS feed for these entries - and then a main RSS feed for my lmorchard.com site to wrangle together all the things I might want to &quot;publish&quot; to the world. Maybe I should start an email newsletter. All the cool kids have done it.</p><hr><p>Thinking about censorship &amp; de-platforming lately. I have had a notion for some years that I've been fuzzily turning around in my head. I'm not sure I'm right, and I don't have this all thought out. I have some hunches, though.</p><p>It goes something like this - <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="freedom%2520of%2520speech%2520does%2520not%2520imply%2520a%2520right%2520to%2520amplification.html">freedom of speech does not imply a right to amplification</a>.</p><hr><p>One of the things I feel like I used to do more was be an information filter &amp; repeater. I'd skim and read items from 100s of RSS feeds and curate what I thought were the good ones into del.icio.us bookmarks with short quippy comments. Sometimes I'd tweet them. Sometimes I'd produce slightly longer blog posts.</p><p>I don't think I do that so much anymore. I think I might like to get back to doing it more. </p><p>Maybe that's what an email newsletter would be for - not that anyone's asking for one from me. They seem kind of insufferable at times.</p><p>Maybe it's just the fashion of the day like belt-onions.</p><hr><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://hyliu.me/fluent-reader/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fluent Reader</a>:</p><blockquote><div>Fluent Reader is a local, cross-platform news aggregator with a fresh look. Bring all your favorite sources with you and read distraction-free. </div></blockquote><p>A bare-bones reader app, but with a card view that matches the way I like to view feeds in recent years. Doesn't quite match my flow - I like to skim and open a queue of things to read in browser tabs, rather than read directly in the app. I can do it with this app, but I have to right-click and &quot;open externally&quot; every time. I think I want to poke at this app a bit more.
