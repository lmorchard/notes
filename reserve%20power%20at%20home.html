						<p>Power outages quickly become problematic. It would be nice to have an option for reserve power at home when that happens.</p><p>Most outages seem to last about a day. I have been through a week-long outage at least once in my life. Would like a lot of spare capacity, though. Does &quot;a lot&quot; mean three days, one week, two weeks, a month? What's the order of magnitude of expense between each versus the likelihood of needing the contingency?</p><p>Endangered essentials roughly include:</p><ul><li>refrigerator</li><li>freezer</li><li>my CPAP at night</li><li>furnace</li><li>AC</li><li>lights</li><li>phone charging</li><li>laptop charging</li></ul><p>On generators:</p><ul><li>I've had one before, I don't have one now.</li><li>Generators go outside, are noisy, can attract attention, can be stolen.</li><li>Needs fuel that can be hard to keep on hand and fresh.</li><li>Acquiring fuel leads to contending with others who also need fuel<ul><li>at best, a long wait at gas station</li><li>at worst, getting stuck in a crowd where bad things happen.</li></ul></li><li>I know there are permanent installation gas whole-house backup generators, but those are spendy.</li><li>Fuel options<ul><li>Gasoline - gas station within walking distance, but it goes stale</li><li>Propane - never dealt with it. Does it go stale? Dangerous to keep around?</li><li>House gas line - assuming it's still working during power outage, possible for a temporary hookup to a portable generator? Bad idea?<ul><li>Grill line is probably too small, need special attention to the pressure draw of the generator and ensure it doesn't starve other things in the house</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>On batteries:</p><ul><li>Haven't dealt with them with respect to a whole-house AC scenario</li><li>Seems like batteries are nice to keep topped up so that when the supply goes out, they're ready to be used. </li><li>Batteries need maintenance - not sure of particulars, would imagine not as bad as keeping fuel on hand?</li><li>More expensive than generator + fuel?</li><li>Shopping ideas?<ul><li>$355 <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Renogy-Battery-Marine-Off-Grid-Applications/dp/B075RGX1WR/ref=sr_1_6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Renogy Deep Cycle Agm Battery 12 Volt 200AH for RV, Solar, Marine, and Off-Grid Applications, Gray `</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>On solar:</p><ul><li>Have never dealt with solar.</li><li>Short of a major project on the roof, would it be useful to have a few panels to put outside in a pinch to bolster batteries?</li></ul><p>Hybrid notions:</p><ul><li>A few days' worth of battery storage to give breathing room?</li><li>A fuel-flexible generator to support batteries when fuel is more easily acquired?</li><li>Would like to be able to shelter-in-place and lay low during instability events for as long as possible to avoid crowds, panic, and rushed thinking</li><li>Some solar panels to charge as possible?</li></ul><p>Random notes &amp; links, which are probably inaccurate as heck:</p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.tesla.com/powerwall/design" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tesla Powerwall</a> - 1 day backup - $12,000.
