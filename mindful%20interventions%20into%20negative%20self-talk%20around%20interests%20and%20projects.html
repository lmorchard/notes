						<p>Been trying to work on interrupting some habitual self-talk &amp; thoughts lately. </p><p>Often, when I think of a video game or a hobby project, I entertain guilt over not doing it - I shame myself because I &quot;should&quot; be doing that.</p><p>All these &quot;neglected&quot; &amp; &quot;abandoned&quot; games &amp; books &amp; projects. As if I have obligations to them and have failed. This is not true - I've signed no contracts, not even with myself. And it's not productive, motivational, or inspirational. It just leaves me feeling ashamed, guilty, and beaten down - by myself, no less. It all adds up into a general background radiation of sadness.</p><p>Instead, what I'm trying on for size is just acknowledging that I'm <em>interested</em> in that particular thing. When the thought comes up, I try to interrupt and tell myself, &quot;No, I'm not obligated, I'm just interested.&quot; Sure, it's an abstractly unfortunate thing if I get through life not having done or engaged with all of my interests. But it's not a moral failure or a useful source of shame.</p><p>And I know that I've historically over-estimated just how many hours there are in a day and my personal capacity &amp; energy in any particular collection of those hours. That's led me to really feeling down on &amp; critical of myself over <em>interests</em> to which I don't get around.</p><p>I also know a lot of this is an artifact of dealing with my own shifting focus &amp; motivation - which I believe is difficult for me thanks to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="ADHD.html">ADHD</a>. I have a low level of self-trust when it comes to committing to something for myself. It seems like whatever capacity I have for commitment and reliability are bound up in keeping my day-to-day livelihood going - and even that is a struggle. It takes a great deal of vigilance to herd the cats that live in my head.</p><p>But, the oldest habitual tool I seem to have for dealing with low self-trust is self-abuse. Guilt &amp; shame &amp; denigration &amp; beratement. I guess it has worked for me at some point for me to have learned it? Maybe it's how I was handled growing up? How else can someone like me be kept on-task and on-time? </p><p>I mean, I'm actually thinking hard about that last question - because I feel like I'm lacking in alternate tools that inspire &amp; energize rather than punish. I <em>would</em> like to engage with my interests. I <em>would</em> like to build momentum on some projects &amp; shareable artifacts. I <em>would</em> like to finish more book and play more games. And, you know, considering <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="age%2520and%2520my%2520career%2520future.html">age and my career future</a>, I <em>would</em> like to explore what could be next for me.</p><p>Other than yielding to the <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHXvMcLrLSY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">whacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube man</a> who controls the mechanism of my focus &amp; enthusiasm, I'm not sure what I can do to make myself more consistent and persistent. Still toying around with notions of refining my systems to capture disjointed efforts and simulate focus by gluing them together, since <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="my%2520brain%2520is%2520a%2520pen%2520plotter%2520drawing%2520unoptimized%2520paths.html">my brain is a pen plotter drawing unoptimized paths</a>.</p><p>But, interrupting the cycle of self-abuse around it seems like a good start, since the only thing that does is send my energy straight to ground when I <em>do</em> get enthused about something - and that's a completely broken process for self-regulation.</p>
