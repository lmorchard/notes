						<p>We've been using a TV antenna to get HD content, supplemented by a rotating array of streaming services - e.g. Netflix, Hulu, etc</p><p>We have no loyalty to any particular service. It's all about what new show happens to appear that we want to watch. We cancel when it's over.</p><p>We do miss the cruise control of a cable-like channel experience, though.</p><p>We tried Playstation Vue for awhile - great service but prices almost doubled.</p><p>We switched to Sling - terrible service, apps often froze or crashed</p><p>We switched to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="YouTube.html">YouTube</a> TV - great service, price going up a lot for channels we don't watch</p><p>Back to the TV antenna and other things. We get like 42 channels of mostly crap but occasional good stuff just by putting a wire in the air.</p><p>And it always pissed me off that we were paying for streams with ads when we can just put a wire in the air for a similar experience.</p><p>There have been things we've enjoyed watching on ye olde cable channels, but we can find other entertainments.</p><p>$65/month is a decent meal of burritos &amp; booze - and we like burritos &amp; booze more</p><p>$65/month is one AAA video game or several indie games - and I like games more
