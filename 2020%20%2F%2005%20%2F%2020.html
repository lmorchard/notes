						<ul><li>Still thinking about <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="StickerBook.html">StickerBook</a>. Considering JSON Linked Data and things like Solid. Haven't built anything. May be overthinking it.</li><li>The Gemini protocol sounds interesting<ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gemini.circumlunar.space/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gemini.circumlunar.space/</a></li><li>Is heavier than gopher; Is lighter than the web; Will not replace either</li></ul></li><li>Thinking about <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="self-regulation.html">self-regulation</a> as a more important adult life skill than any particular talent.</li><li>I should update my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="MiSTer.html">MiSTer</a> setup - new stuff got released!</li><li>New film from the director of &quot;Sleep Dealer&quot;, which I really liked - <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.infiltratorsfilm.com/stream-the-infiltrators/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Infiltrators</a><ul><li>tl;dr: undercover activists infiltrate detention centers for undocumented immigrants with the intent to get folks set free</li></ul></li><li>I feel like <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="my%2520brain%2520is%2520a%2520pen%2520plotter%2520drawing%2520unoptimized%2520paths.html">my brain is a pen plotter drawing unoptimized paths</a>.<ul><li>Swing over to the northwest quadrant, sketch a couple of lines. Swing way over to southeast, draw a small curve. To the center, draw a square. Back to northwest, connect the lines with another line. Way over to northeast, ink one dot.</li><li>Let the thing go long enough and a picture <em>might</em> emerge. Along the way, there's no sensible narrative to follow.</li><li>Without taking notes like in this wiki, it's like my brain's running on a CRT. The vector drawing is so slow and scattered that the phosphors fade before any pattern emerges.</li><li>Trying to find an example of a pen plotter drawing unsorted lines. I seem to remember seeing <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://twitter.com/joshu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joshua schachter</a> post a video of this, once upon a time.</li><li>This seems to discuss the thing I'm thinking about, too <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://nb.paulbutler.org/optimizing-plots-with-tsp-solver/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://nb.paulbutler.org/optimizing-plots-with-tsp-solver/</a></li></ul></li><li>Damn it, now I want to get a pen plotter to play with.</li><li>Though it feels good un-spooling my brain like this as things pop up, the problem is that I still need to do things to meet expectations in a timely manner. You know, like, work that I get paid for. Does feel like I have fewer unruly thought children bouncing up and down in my head when I let them out here, though. So maybe I'll find focus come easier as I keep this up.</li><li>Back to that thought about <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="self-regulation.html">self-regulation</a> earlier: Takes a spike of willpower to interrupt my flow and redirect myself to something more goal-aligned. Doesn't always work. Keep trying.</li><li>Some reoccurring sci-fi ideas I've had, if I ever got the gumption to get back to writing stories (these are not entirely novel, they're just things I like):<ul><li>Consider a truly alien &amp; advanced civilization</li><li>Their technological artifacts wouldn't look like robots with tentacle arms<ul><li>Their technology might look like origami-folding <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/metamaterials" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">metamaterials</a> that flex &amp; fold &amp; rotate &amp; expand in ways that hurt our brains to even track</li></ul></li><li>And they have no inevitable organics-vs-synthetics conflict.<ul><li>What if the entire reason they were ever able to leave their planets is because they kicked off a peaceful co-evolution with their own quasi-sentient machines?</li><li>Like, what if the synthetics don't kill the organics because they <em>like</em> the organics and <em>want</em> to work together?</li></ul></li><li>And consider their sociopolitical technology is also advanced to have even gotten this far.<ul><li>What if they're not colonizers but just neighbors</li><li>David Brin came up with at least one dark enlightened scenario - i.e. habitable planets are precious &amp; rare, enforced galactic law asserts that species who cannot take care of them lose the privilege of sovereignty even if they evolved there, good luck with resisting that</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="2020%2520%252F%252005%2520%252F%252020%2520-%2520stream%2520notes.html">2020 / 05 / 20 - stream notes</a> - I streamed. I replaced the joystick on my left joycon for the Nintendo Switch but I broke the ZL button. Trying hard not to be very angry and disappointed. Found a replacement part that's on the way. Ugh.<ul><li>Trying to be sanguine about this and tell myself that anything can be fixed. And I will fix this.</li></ul></li></ul>
