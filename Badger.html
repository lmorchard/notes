						<h2 class="">Ancient History</h2><p>Once upon a time, <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://decafbad.com/2010/07/badger-article/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I thought badges for Mozilla would be a good idea</a>. I tried pursing it as a Thing at Mozilla but didn't have the energy / clout / connections / personality / whatever to make it happen myself.</p><p>Other folks did Open Badges, but I never quite gained any traction around there. I wanted something kind of whimsical and light weight and in python. They wanted something more serious and like micro-credentials and in node. I got busy with other things and they eventually spun out into their own foundation.</p><p>I did at one point stand up a demo I called badg.us. But, people started trying to use it for real, and I wasn't ready to handle that. Got some teachers with students creating porn badges and I decided to nuke most of the site before handing it over to a Mozilla community ops group, where it eventually got sunset.</p><p>I might want to do this thing again, but with an explicit focus on whimsy and sticker collection.</p><p>I also started playing with this lightweight &quot;art maker&quot; to use a clip art collage concept for creating badges / stickers: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://github.com/lmorchard/art-maker" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/lmorchard/art-maker</a></p>
