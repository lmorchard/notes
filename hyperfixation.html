					<section class="post-content">
						<p>I've read that hyperfixation is a characteristic of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="ADHD.html">ADHD</a>. I experience this maybe once a month or so. It might be a video game, it might be refreshing Twitter, it might be cleaning my office, it might be refilling all my fountain pens, it might be reading a book, it might be getting a task done at work.</p><p>I rarely seem to be able to choose when it happens or the subject of the fixation. If it happens in a way aligned with my goals, I can accomplish amazing things. If it doesn't, well, then I don't really accomplish anything in particular.</p><p>It feels good when it happens. Tunnel-vision lock-on. I feel anxiety &amp; dread &amp; pain lift for a little while. It's rewarding to feel so focused. Usually accompanied with a flow state. I feel my brain working, I feel clear, I feel imbued with purpose.</p><p>When the smoke clears, I'm usually exhausted. If I managed to lock onto a task aligned with goals, I feel gratified. If not, I end up feeling more depressed and like hours evaporated. Maybe if it was a game, I can sometimes try to tell myself maybe I enjoyed the time?</p><p>Also, quite often I totally and abruptly lose interest in the topic of fixation after the focus clears. I could throw 10 hours in one sitting into a video game - and then want nothing to do with it again for a year. And then a year later, fall hard for it again. </p><p>Occasionally it lasts a bit longer - once I was devoted to EVE Online for a month or so and then dropped it for a year. Intensity with a sudden absence of interest like flipping a switch.</p><h2 class="">Links</h2><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://totallyadd.com/blog/hyperfixation-and-adhd/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://totallyadd.com/blog/hyperfixation-and-adhd/</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bj3vwp/hyperfixation_disinterest_apathy_and_anhedonia/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bj3vwp/hyperfixation_disinterest_apathy_and_anhedonia/</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/hyperfocus-flow" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/hyperfocus-flow</a></li></ul>
