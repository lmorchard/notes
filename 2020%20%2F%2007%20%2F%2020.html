						<p>Hello world.</p><p>Thinking about <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="mindful%2520interventions%2520into%2520negative%2520self-talk%2520around%2520interests%2520and%2520projects.html">mindful interventions into negative self-talk around interests and projects</a>.</p><p>Thinking about <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="time%2520management%2520in%2520games%2520like%2520Persona%25205%2520versus%2520my%2520own%2520life.html">time management in games like Persona 5 versus my own life</a>.</p><p>Also, I'm trying to deflect guilt over not finishing Persona 5 - see <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="mindful%2520interventions%2520into%2520negative%2520self-talk%2520around%2520interests%2520and%2520projects.html">the previous thing I was thinking about</a>.</p><p>Feeling a slight urge to play with some <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="GameDev.html">GameDev</a> again. Every time I've done it so far, it's been vaguely in the service of sharpening up my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="WebDev.html">WebDev</a> chops. I've wanted to learn more about audio, graphics, gamepad, and worker APIs and figured games were a good way to get there. I also started learning <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Rust.html">Rust</a> via <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="GameDev.html">GameDev</a>.</p><p>Thing is, though, it's been so very rare that any game I've actually ended up playing was written for the web. Not even the indie stuff. I would have thought by now that the state of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="GameDev.html">GameDev</a> on the web would have made it really worth doing. Guess not? Seems kind of sad to me. I kind of want to make a game that you can just drop into from an URL. Have I not looked hard enough?</p><p>Matt Haughey: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/2020/07/18/building-diy-led-strips-for-fun/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Building DIY LED strips for fun</a>:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>If you’ve watched <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="YouTube.html">YouTube</a> or Twitch streamers, you might have noticed they have interesting backgrounds behind them, often with colored LED lighting on shelves or in corners. My new home office has a bunch of built-in floating shelves and I thought it’d be a perfect place to install LED strips.
...
Your lights will be controlled by a tiny computer chip with a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="WiFi.html">WiFi</a> adapter in it and the one you want is a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="NodeMCU.html">NodeMCU</a> ESP8266.
</p></blockquote><p>My office is a mess right now, but this would be neat to set up in there and maybe around my basement workbench where I've been <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Streaming.html">Streaming</a></p><p>I think <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Gom%2520Jabbar%2520Test%2520of%2520Humanity.html">The Gom Jabbar Test of Humanity</a> really had an impact on my notions around becoming an adult human. I saw it in David Lynch's Dune probably at around age 10. The whole movie was formative in a trippy way.</p><p>This is probably in poor taste, but: I'm imagining a protest-themed, squad-based hero game. Mom shields, leaf blower dads, retired vet tanks, streamer mages, drum &amp; chant bards, fully-nude enchanters, parkour fence-topplers, street medics, snack grillers. I've seen all of these characters in Portland.</p><p>Some hopeful news about COVID-19 vaccines &amp; duration - <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/could-covid-19-immunity-really-disappear-months/614377/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How Long Does COVID-19 Immunity Last?</a>:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Let’s say I learn to solve a Rubik’s Cube. Three weeks later, you might ask me how I did it. I can’t really describe every step from memory, I tell you. But then you hand me a Rubik’s Cube, and I suddenly recall my strategy and solve that sucker in half the time. Similarly, the KCL study might initially seem to describe a forgetful antibody response. But, primed by the reappearance of COVID-19, our immune system might snap back and mount a powerful defense.
