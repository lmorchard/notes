						<p>Hello world. Hmm, missed yesterday.</p><hr><p>Played a bit with Microsoft Flight Simulator. Neat, ambitious. I can fly anywhere. But, when I get there, things look real enough that the not-real and inaccurate stuff sticks out. Guess that's the uncanny valley thing.</p><hr><p>So, I'm musing <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Starnet.html">Starnet</a> and graph-based hacking puzzles. Eventually, I'd like to procedurally generate. Before I get there, I have to work out what's actually a fun puzzle by building some by hand</p><p>This thing looks interesting for that - <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://flume.dev/docs/node-editor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://flume.dev/docs/node-editor</a></p><p>And by &quot;graph-based&quot; I mean a system of networked devices. Need to subvert / exploit / redirect the parts of the system in order to get to the goal. Like a storage server reports to an log collector monitored by a security node. Touch storage before security and ALARMS</p><hr><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://learn.circuit.rocks/esp32-cam-with-rtsp-video-streaming" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Also tinkered a bit with an ESP32-CAM</a> that I've had sitting on my workshop shelf for awhile. I've got vague ambitions to add it to my OBS streaming setup. I may be disappointed in that, since the thing seems way more suited to taking so-so static shots than streaming video. </p><p>Then again, <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://github.com/espressif/esp32-camera/issues/15" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I have read that I can possibly get 60FPS out of it at 352 x 288 resolution</a> - which is not terrible for one of my side-panels, maybe good to point it at a meter or a small diagram.</p><p>Tinkering also with a Raspberry Pi Zero W and a camera module as an OBS source. Still have more to do, but it might be useful to use as a facecam blue-tacked to my workbench. That, or a better detail camera. Hell, maybe I'll slap it on a headband so I can more easily stream things I'm holding in my hands that are otherwise hard to share.</p><p>And there's a Raspberry Pi 4 on the workbench that I'm going to try using as a host for some USB cameras, also with an aim at piping them into OBS. It's got USB 3, so maybe it can handle a couple of cameras at a decent frame rate and stream them over my wired LAN.</p><p>All of this is basically an alternative to trying to cram everything onto the USB bus of my streaming PC. </p>
