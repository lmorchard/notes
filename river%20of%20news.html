Text is truncated to less than 500 characters. Markup is removed from the description text. </p><p>Items are grouped by feed</p><p>If more than one item from a feed is gathered in a single read of the feed, they are grouped together, so that the feed information is not repeated for each item.</p><p>Browsing via the vertical scrollbar</p><p>It's designed so it can be browsed by dragging the thumb of the scrollbar up and down. The eye is very good at scanning this way. That's why each item is roughly the same size as all the others: to facilitate scanning.</p><p>If it requires more interaction than simply scrolling, it is not a River of News. A perfectly fine feed reader can be built that works in other ways, but if it does not have this feature, it is not a River of News.
