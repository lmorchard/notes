</p></blockquote><p>I didn't reply to the thread, but it's got me thinking. I don't feel like side projects are optional for me and I feel anxious when I don't have one brewing. I don't know that this is great or healthy - but it is also how I have learned a great many things that later became professionally useful.</p><p>I do also really feel a need to lay off in off hours. Do something else. Have a non-programming hobby.</p><p>I also worry about <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="age%2520and%2520my%2520career%2520future.html">age and my career future</a> and falling behind in my career.</p><p>I don't have coherent thoughts here, yet.
