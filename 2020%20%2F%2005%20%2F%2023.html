						<p>Played a bunch more with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Easy-Blog%2520Oven.html">Easy-Blog Oven</a> last night. Made big progress. Got page templates working, built all the individual entries along with indexes for months &amp; years &amp; tags &amp; recent entries on front page. It all came together really fast. </p><p>Also, it seems kind of ludicrous: I'm just loading all 1000+ blog posts into memory at once and then basically map/filter/reduce my way though the data. It all takes 4 seconds to build most of my blog.</p><p>Worked a bunch more on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Easy-Blog%2520Oven.html">Easy-Blog Oven</a> and I think I've almost got it at the point where it could step in as a replacement for rendering my blog. So, like, maybe I should think about writing something and start using it. A few more tweaks, maybe, to set it up with a file watcher to generate previews for in-progress drafts. And then maybe some <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="GitHub%2520Actions.html">GitHub Actions</a> exploration to set it up for auto-publishing.</p><p>Okay, so I worked almost all day on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Easy-Blog%2520Oven.html">Easy-Blog Oven</a>. I ported over the blog posts from my old gulp blog, preserving the history with git filter-branch. Then, I played around with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Github%2520Actions.html">Github Actions</a> to come up with a clunky quick action that builds and publishes the blog to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Github%2520Pages.html">Github Pages</a> on a push to stage branch. Next thing might be to get a similar action that publishes the content to my AWS S3 bucket - that is, unless I feel like hosting entirely from Github. Hmm.</p><p>The repair parts for my Switch joycon arrived late tonight. Thinking I might take a shot at finishing the repair and purple shell replacement tomorrow on my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Streaming.html">stream</a>.</p><p>Watched the show Upload on Amazon Prime for a few episodes after dinner tonight. Really interesting dramedy about being uploaded to a virtual world after death (or even slightly before). There may also have been a murder. Reminds me a little bit of <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyone_in_Silico" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jim Munroe's Everyone in Silico</a></p>
