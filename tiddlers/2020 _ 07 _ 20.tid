Hello world.

Thinking about [[mindful interventions into negative self-talk around interests and projects]].

Thinking about [[time management in games like Persona 5 versus in my own life]].

I think [[The Gom Jabbar Test of Humanity]] really had an impact on my notions around becoming an adult human. I saw it in David Lynch's Dune probably at around age 10. The whole movie was formative in a trippy way.

This is probably in poor taste, but: I'm imagining a protest-themed, squad-based hero game. Mom shields, leaf blower dads, retired vet tanks, streamer mages, drum & chant bards, fully-nude enchanters, parkour fence-topplers, street medics, snack grillers. I've seen all of these characters in Portland.

Let’s say I learn to solve a Rubik’s Cube. Three weeks later, you might ask me how I did it. I can’t really describe every step from memory, I tell you.

But, primed by the reappearance of COVID-19, our immune system might snap back and mount a powerful defense.
