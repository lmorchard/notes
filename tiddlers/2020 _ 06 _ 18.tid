* Good morning. Hello world.
* About 10 years ago, I recovered a pile of my old high-school era poetry and journal entries from Commodore 64 floppies.
** The cringe I felt nearly drove me through the floor ðŸ˜‚
** I'm feeling a bit of that now, reading things I wrote 10-15 years ago ðŸ˜…
** Makes me wonder what I'll think of me now, 10 years from now ðŸ˜¬
* Gave a small demo at work today about Storybook and GitHub Status Checks
** Maybe I should blog about it?
** [[Storybook]] is a tool we use to generate static mini-sites with "stories" or demos of React components we use on our product 
** [[Status checks|https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-status-checks]] are pass/fail status messages attached to GitHub commits that can link to a target URL
** We build Storybooks for each commit to master and for Pull Requests and set a status check with a link to the Storybook build hosted via [[Github Pages]]
