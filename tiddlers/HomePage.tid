Hi. My name's [[Les Orchard|https://lmorchard.com]]. You can read more [[about me on my (other) home page|https://lmorchard.com]].

This is a place where I'm trying to dump things out of my leaky brain bucket so I can stop stressing about remembering or losing them.

I'm currently using TiddlyWiki for this and StaticRendering to publish the notes on the web so as to [[Work with the garage door up]].

This will never be a polished presentation of anything necessarily coherent.

!! Recent changes

Random things change around here as I unload my brain to more durable storage.

!! Recent journals

Trying to open a note every day and spew brain things into it.

!! Index topics

Rough attempt to organize some things? Needs more work to be useful.
