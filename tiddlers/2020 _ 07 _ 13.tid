Hello world.

Steadily busy day, but not as brain melting as most days last week.

[[Printed TS100 Case Beats The Heat With A Bearing|https://hackaday.com/2020/07/12/printed-ts100-case-beats-the-heat-with-a-bearing/]] I kind of want to get a TS100 soldering iron. They look nifty. I should get back to streaming from my workbench too, though.

Really wish I could maintain consistent enthusiasm for [[Streaming]], because the tech around it fascinates me.

Richard Feynman: [[Do not remain nameless to yourself|https://lettersofnote.com/2015/10/23/do-not-remain-nameless-to-yourself/]]

<<<
You say you are a nameless man. You are not to your wife and to your child. You will not long remain so to your immediate colleagues if you can answer their simple questions when they come into your office. You are not nameless to me. Do not remain nameless to yourself – it is too sad a way to be. Know your place in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in terms of your naïve ideals of your own youth, nor in terms of what you erroneously imagine your teacher’s ideals are.
