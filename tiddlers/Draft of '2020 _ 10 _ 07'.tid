Haven't done a lot of [[working with the garage door up|Work with the garage door up]] lately.

Mostly been trying to get work done during the day. Distract myself from doomscrolling with [[EVE Echoes]] until my [[ADHD]] brain decides we're done with it. 

Kind of hoping I can bargain with myself to do some more creative work like I started with my "[[Swinth 2020|https://lmorchard.github.io/swinth2020/index.html]]" demo back on [[2020 / 09 / 16]] or maybe some continued [[GameDev]] on [[Starnet]].

For awhile, I internalized "butt in seat" and force myself to do the thing as the way to go. But, all that does is make me feel absolutely terrible and a failure. 

Assuming [[ADHD]] is my malady, the lack of executive function renders "butt in seat" a non-starter. So, I'm kind of trying to abide and feel myself out. See if I can surf my own semi-uncontrollable hyperfocus and nudge it toward things I'd like to do in terms of higher-order life goals. But, I have utterly failed at simply steering myself at anything via main force of will.
