title: I'd like to produce more
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

I'd like to produce more... everything.

Writing, tinkering, sharing, stories, games, whatever.

Why?

* Because I'd like to.
* Because producing is often learning, and I like learning.
* Because I sometimes see life benefits from doing so.
* Because I get a paycheck for some of them.

Maybe I pressure myself too much on this? Too much hustle. Not many hobbies for the hell of it.
