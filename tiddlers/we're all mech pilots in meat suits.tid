title: we're all mech pilots in meat suits
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

TL;DR: Like a mech pilot in a meat suit, I pull levers connected to a [[fly-by-wire system|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly-by-wire]]. As such, I am not in direct command. My day-to-day experience of living feels like an ongoing self-negotiation with aspects of my body & brain that are not under my arbitrary control.

Learning how to accept, shape, regulate, and leverage this whole system seems to be one of the biggest projects of adulthood.

A consequence from all of this that frustrates me is that I often feel unable to commit to or promise some things.

I'll try my best, but I know that sometimes my second-stage co-processors blink out or the servo-actuator in the mech's right knee seizes. It's out of my direct control. I'll do all I can to compensate and workaround.

Sometimes I succeed. Sometimes the mech falls over, despite my best percussive maintenance on sparking modules and furious switch-flipping all over the cockpit panels.

As a meat suit, the mech is an animal. Of course it is. I am an animal. And like all our pet animals at home, I have to work to gain trust and affection and take care of it and be kind to it. 

Oh, but all our pets are cats & bunnies. No dogs. You don't really train cats & bunnies to be obedient - you make friends with them. If you're lucky, you convince them to do what you want and that also it's what they want do to anyway.

Working with myself often feels [[like herding cats|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_MaJDK3VNE]].

And [[watching a bunny "cheat" at an obstacle course|https://imgur.com/gallery/JhRxVSc]].

I guess that's what I'm trying to say.

It's hard to consider one's //self// as an emergent property of an assemblage of parts. Personally, though, I believe that's what //I// am.

And whatever //I// am feels like a mech pilot wrestling with a meat suit. The meat suit often has its own input into what we're thinking & doing. Because it's not just the physical motion of the body, it's the computational patterns of my headspace.

Of course I know that whatever //I// am is not some indivisible atomic homunculus. I'm an emanation of the meat suit interacting with itself. Whatever //I// am is more like a standing wave than a machine composed of fixed parts. I'm self-modifying code also being modified by other parts of the suit. (Go read [[GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach]].)

I have the notion that my psychology is more a product of manifold processes rather than a unified single personality. We / me often produce an outwardly apparent simulation of unity, if only by virtue of physical locality and the projection of a situational persona. But inside, there's lots of push / pull by a chorus of independently operating circuits.

I've also read this meat-suit-mech-pilot notion from folks using it to encode their feeling of bodily disassociation. That is, their mental map of viscera has mismatches with the current physical state. Dysphoria, et al. I don't experience that so much myself, but I can imagine the joy in correcting that mismatch by whatever method proves necessary.

I often try to remind myself that, whenever I encounter another human, they too are a mech pilot in a meat suit.
