Hello world.

Missed a couple of days here, not that anyone's really counting.

Spent Saturday cooking food out on the charcoal grill and bingeing on Season 3 of [[The Leviathan Chronicles|https://www.leviathanchronicles.com/]]. That's a really well-produced, pulpy sci-fi drama podcast.

Kind of a weird nostalgia vortex: I started listening to [[The Leviathan Chronicles|https://www.leviathanchronicles.com/]] back in 2008. Around then, we moved back from California to Michigan and bought our first house. Lots of memories of long bike rides and yard work along with everything else going on back then. Unfortunately, the author experienced a family tragedy, so the show went on hiatus for a pile of years. But, 12 years later, the end of the original story arc is here.
