In February 2021, I played with converting [[Super Star Trek to JavaScript]]. It's a text-based game, but I've got notions of tinkering with it further. Apropos of that, I have my [[WGL6100]] code for drawing glowy lines that I'd like to develop further.

What if I made a flashier version of Super Star Trek that looked like the displays from Wrath of Khan?
