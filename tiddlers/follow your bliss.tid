Joseph Campbell said, "If you follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living. Wherever you are â€” if you are following your bliss, you are enjoying that refreshment, that life within you, all the time."
