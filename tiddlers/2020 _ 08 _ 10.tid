Hello world.

For some reason, I forgot I had a sit-stand desk and have only been sitting. Started standing again recently and it's been nice. A little less depressing, if only because I'm literally not as low.

I can't remember why I last stopped. That will probably be why I stop again.

Thinking about building a [[DIY WIFI BBQ thermometer]] after doing all this grilling.
