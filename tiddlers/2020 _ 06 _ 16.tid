* Good morning
* Still feeling a bit de-energized and de-focused and [[depressed|depression]]
** The annoying thing about mood disorder is how much cognitive / rational work I continually have to do in order to keep myself convinced about things that a) I like and b) are good for me.
** As in, I //know// that this certain set of things are indeed things that enthuse me and I enjoy -  even if I'm entirely ahedonic at the present moment.
*** It's fucking exhausting, like needing to continually switch from autopilot to manual for keeping my personality from de-rezzing. 
*** Like dynamic RAM that needs a regular refresh operation to ensure it retains data, except that the refresh operation has to be done by hand
** So easy to latch onto the present mood as a generalized existential statement about whatever I'm trying to spend attention on
** It's a dirty window that I just can't seem to clean
* I'm at a virtual all hands for Mozilla this week
** Want to take & share screen shots of the [[Mozilla Hubs]] room I'm in, but it's not entirely public
** Weird, awkward living in the future moment
** Makes me want to learn how to use Blender to build an avatar
* I found more of my older notes in Eastgate [[Tinderbox]]
** Mulling over how to access / convert / make useful those notes now that I don't even have a Mac on my desk.
** Kind of miss that app, vaguely nostalgic about [[this article I wrote about writing articles with Tinderbox|https://decafbad.com/2010/06/tinderbox-article-tutorial/article.html]]
* Thinking about how I've written articles and things
** But I seem to pick things that aren't super popular
** A lot of effort into things few people see
** Would be nice to get traction in a niche, but my [[ADHD]] seems to keep me from sticking anywhere for long
* Trying to dig up and review the last two decades (!) of my old notes in various formats
** Because I'd like to see what I used to be doing
** And maybe plot the vector to what I'm doing now
** And maybe extend the vector to what I could be doing a decade from now
** It feels weird
