* Good morning, took the day off work today
* Tinkered a bit with [[AboutMePage]]
** Got publishing via Github Actions working
** Attempting [[a scheduled workflow|https://github.com/lmorchard/about-me/commit/542cb8d1f560bf95f1f61bee72401532e6895e09]] for regular updates rather than running it from my home LAN - [[and it worked!|https://github.com/lmorchard/about-me/runs/767530702?check_suite_focus=true]]
* Thinking I might want to blog about this revamped AboutMePage thing
** Dropped React & Webpack for tagged template literals and my own minimal asset procesing
** Using Github Actions to fetch data sources and publish to AWS S3
** Discovered that Github Actions supports scheduled workflows with cronjob format
* Experimenting in [[StaticRendering]] with adding Disqus comments to every notes page
* Thinking about [[Project Gemini]]
* Thinking about my hacked [[Nintendo 3DS]] and how I'm kind of itching to hack my [[Nintendo Switch]] but want to wait until it's lifecycle has passed onto whatever Nintendo's next console might be.
