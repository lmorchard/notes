I'd like to blog about this. Maybe I'll take some notes first and then turn the notes into a post?

!! Super Star Trek?

[[Super Star Trek|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(1971_video_game)#Super_Star_Trek]] is a circa-1978 roguelike space combat game set in the original Star Trek series universe. It's implemented in BASIC and offers an [[ASCII art|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art]] interface to a roughly turn-based game loop.

The goal is to explore a galactic grid of randomized space sectors, in order to hunt down and destroy all enemy Klingon ships before the given deadline elapses. Time passes during ship movement, repairs, and firing weapons - so there's pressure to be efficient in exploration and there's a cost to taking damage or using up ship resources.

The ship has limited energy and an array of functional systems like scanners, shields, phasers, torpedoes, warp drive, and a library-computer that offers a handful of utility functions. Any of these systems can be damaged & disabled in combat, which can radically alter game play at any point. Systems also have a chance to fail, improve, or be repaired during travel.

Finally, there are a number of Starbases scattered around the galaxy that can effect repairs and replenish the ship on docking - though these need to be discovered through exploration just like enemy ships.

All-in-all, I think Super Star Trek is an impressively sophisticated game considering the limitations of BASIC and the computers on which it originally ran. It also inspired a few other games - such as Atari's Star Raiders, another personal favorite of mine!

!! My history with Super Star Trek

It was probably around 1982 when I first encountered Super Star Trek as a type-in program listing in [[David Ahl's BASIC Computer Games|https://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=157]].
