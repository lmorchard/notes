!! Super Star Trek?

[[Super Star Trek|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(1971_video_game)#Super_Star_Trek]] is a circa-1978 roguelike space combat game set in the original Star Trek series universe. It's implemented in BASIC and offers an [[ASCII art|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art]] interface to a roughly turn-based game loop.
