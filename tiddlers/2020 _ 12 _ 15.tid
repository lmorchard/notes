Hello world. It's been awhile - a little over 2 months.

I had a pretty good run of almost 5 months of jotting entries here, then I stopped. This is how I am with nearly all things, if I'm not driven by fear of calamity to continue.

I'm not sure why I operate this way, but it frustrates me. Not being "into" something for very long keeps me from building up much momentum and keeps me from finishing things.

Still trying to figure out how to better work with [[the random pen plotter that is my brain|my brain is a pen plotter drawing unoptimized paths]] after 45 years.
