Hello world.

Last night, I found a backup of a VM disk image from a work laptop many, many jobs ago. Fell down a rabbit hole figuring out how to get a look at the files inside. The image wouldn't boot. Turns out it was a FreeBSD image. Managed to get it mounted with a live CD ISO, only to find symlinks and references to files that had lived on an NFS mount somewhere in the office network back then. ðŸ˜ž Just enough info to guess it might have been fun to look at all that ancient work, but none of the actual files themselves.
