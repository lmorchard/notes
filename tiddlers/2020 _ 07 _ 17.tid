Hello world.

Ohh, it never occurred to me to [[try roasting coffee on a charcoal BBQ grill|https://thesmokingbottle.com/2016/02/08/fire-roasted-coffee/]]. I like both roasting coffee //and// charcoal grilling. Maybe I could get a spare Behmor mesh roasting drum [[and try it with a power drill|https://www.instructables.com/id/BBQ-Coffee-Roasting/]] for the hackery of it. Though, this [[Mochiglory Rotisserie Basket Coffee Bean BBQ Grill Roaster Drum |https://www.amazon.com/Mochiglory-Rotisserie-Basket-Coffee-Roaster/dp/B07BHM54PP/]] looks pretty cheap too.

Last night, I found a backup of a VM disk image from a work laptop many, many jobs ago. Fell down a rabbit hole figuring out how to get a look at the files inside. The image wouldn't boot. Turns out it was a FreeBSD image. Managed to get it mounted with a live CD ISO, only to find symlinks and references to files that had lived on an NFS mount somewhere in the office network back then. ðŸ˜ž Just enough info to guess it might have been fun to look at all that ancient work, but none of the actual files themselves.
