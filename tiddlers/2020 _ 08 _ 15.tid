Hello world.

Matt Webb posts [[about aboutfeeds.com|http://interconnected.org/home/2020/07/29/improving_rss]]. 

That gets me thinking about [[my feed herder browser extension experiment|https://github.com/lmorchard/feed-herder]] from a couple of years ago - it rode shot gun while browsing to discover RSS feeds and auto-assemble a river from history. At least, that was the idea. It was kind of chunky and doesn't seem all that practical to just do all in one browser while I'm living on multiple PCs and a phone.

Thinking about feeds also gets me thinking about [[Activity Streams]] and ActivityPub.

Also, [[I refreshed|https://github.com/lmorchard/starnet/tree/new-proto]] the [[Starnet]] tinkering I did with ECSY over last xmas break. New version of ECSY with breaking changes, but they were good changes. My vague goal is to pair this up with some glowy-vector webgl stuff and see if I can gin up a little netrunner hacking puzzle.

Skipping any kind of build step, seeing how far I can get with native module support and modern vanilla JS features. Maybe I'll back into an optimized build later. 

I also want to screw around with glitching the rendering. Like, if you're hacking and get hit with counter measure programs, maybe the lines start to drift & jitter like a bad Atari Tempest monitor. Maybe a lava-lamp plasma field overlays the screen like migraine auras.

Speaking of gamedev, [[Bevy looks like a neat engine in Rust|https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/]]. Though, Rust macros can look like "[[templated C++ and Perl had a fight and everybody lost|https://twitter.com/_benui/status/1294398871771025408]]".

[[Jupyter Book|https://blog.jupyter.org/announcing-the-new-jupyter-book-cbf7aa8bc72e]] looks neato. If I ever get around to writing another book, I think I want to make it [[an executable book|https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/]].
