* Hello world. Dang, July already?
* Carving out 30 minutes to read from [[Atomic Habits]] this morning
** I keep intending to read at night, but I seem brain-dead by then
* [[Assault trombone|https://laughingsquid.com/trombone-rifle/]]
* [[Won't you take me closer to funkytown?|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS3mJ5pFndk]]
* [[Presenter's t-shirt changes every time the scene changes to him|https://us.pycon.org/2020/schedule/presentation/96/]]
** (also, static typing in Python)
* [[Create a React Teleprompter using the Web SpeechRecognition API|https://elijahmanor.com/react-teleprompter]]
** This looks neat. Speech recognition to detect progress through a script on a prompter.
* [[Libravatar|https://www.libravatar.org/]]
** I use Gravatar for most generic avatar needs. This seems an interesting alternative
* [[entr(1) - Run arbitrary commands when files change|http://eradman.com/entrproject/]]
** I already use [[onchange|https://www.npmjs.com/package/onchange]] to run a command on file change, but this looks like another interesting file watcher - especially how it takes file lists from stdin
** Found via [[Julia Evans|https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/06/28/entr/]]
* [[NovaChat is a new desktop client that aggregates all your chat networks into one app.|https://nova.chat/]]
** We keep doing this every decade or so - new chat silos, new chat silo breakers
* Wish I had a good word for "you are making fully reasonable demands of me yet I feel temporarily unable to handle them at this very moment"
