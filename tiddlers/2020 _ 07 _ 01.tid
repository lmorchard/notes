* Hello world. Dang, July already?
* Carving out 30 minutes to read from [[Atomic Habits]] this morning
** I keep intending to read at night, but I seem brain-dead by then
* [[Thinking about COVID-19 and a vaccine|https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/1278446311373758464]]
** Makes me think of a process that's been doing on as long as I've been alive.
** Imagine a company or a group that makes good products or does good work.
** That group gets taken over or purchased.
** The new management carries on with the same name and external messaging as always
** Meanwhile, the innards are hollowed out, all corners cut, all processes by which anything good came about in the first place are demolished
** The positive momentum built by the real deal before the co-opting fuels a harvest for the new management
** The thing collapses, the new management moves on
** Feels like that process is coming close to completion for my entire country

* [[Create a React Teleprompter using the Web SpeechRecognition API|https://elijahmanor.com/react-teleprompter]]
** This looks neat. Speech recognition to detect progress through a script on a prompter.
* [[Libravatar|https://www.libravatar.org/]]
** I use Gravatar for most generic avatar needs. This seems an interesting alternative
* [[entr(1) - Run arbitrary commands when files change|http://eradman.com/entrproject/]]
** I already use [[onchange|https://www.npmjs.com/package/onchange]] to run a command on file change, but this looks like another interesting file watcher - especially how it takes file lists from stdin

** We keep doing this every decade or so - new chat silos, new chat silo breakers
* Wish I had a good word for "you are making fully reasonable demands of me yet I feel temporarily unable to handle them at this very moment"
