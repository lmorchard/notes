Hello world.

Andrew Aquino [[tweets|https://twitter.com/aqandrew/status/1349762018639638528]]: "Those Cistercian numerals from 4 days ago (or maybe 800 years ago) made for some fun React/SVG practice. It's a nifty way to represent integers from 0-9999."

This is a neat way to represent numbers. I kind of want to use it as a countdown timer in something.
