title: Storybook and Github Status Checks
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* Gave a demo at work today about what I've done with [[Storybook]] and [[GitHub Status Checks|https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-status-checks]]
* Maybe I should blog about it?
* [[Storybook]] is a tool we use to generate static mini-sites with demos (i.e. "stories") of [[React]] components we use on [[Firefox Accounts]] 
* [[Status checks|https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-status-checks]] are pass/fail status messages attached to GitHub commits that can link to a target URL
* We build Storybooks for each commit to master and for Pull Requests and set a status check with a link to the Storybook build hosted via [[Github Pages]]
** [[build-storybooks.sh|https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/blob/master/_scripts/build-storybooks.sh]] - a shell script that builds the storybook for the current commit and assembles metadata
*** [[The status check is posted via curl|https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/blob/master/_scripts/build-storybooks.sh#L105]]
** [[build-storybooks-indexes.js|https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/blob/master/_scripts/build-storybooks-indexes.js]] - a node JS script that generates index pages for a static site that organize and link to past storybook builds

Putting it all together, this means that clicking the green checkmark on a commit in our repo will link to a storybook build if that commit has changed relevant React components
