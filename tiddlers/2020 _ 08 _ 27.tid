I [[keep meaning to learn & tinker more|https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/1299015085193486344]] with these technologies:

[[Beaker Browser|https://beakerbrowser.com/]]

[[Hypercore is a distributed append-only log|https://hypercore-protocol.org/]]

 Hypercore comes with a secure transport protocol, making it easy to build fast and scalable peer-to-peer applications. Think lightweight blockchain crossed with BitTorrent.

Hypercore currently serves as the foundation for a diverse range of P2P applications, including chat apps, filesystems, databases, and even a browser for the distributed internet. And the whole thing's MIT-licensed, so you can use it as you like!
