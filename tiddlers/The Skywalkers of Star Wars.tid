title: The Skywalkers of Star Wars

TL;DR: I think the Skywalker family is cursed, along with the entire embedded notion of obsessing over and valorizing a quasi-royal midichlorian-enriched bloodline with near-exclusive access to divine power.

And while I'm at it, the Jedi & Sith are pretty rotten too - maybe the Force only has a Light & Dark side because those assholes force it into that pattern.

I'd love to see a Star Wars timeline where the galaxy rebels against all the above and pursues a new story overall.

I don't think I've got entirely original thoughts, but I've sure got some thoughts. Here's a brain dump, until or unless I clean it all up into something coherent:

I've seen every Star Wars movie in the theater, with the exception of Star Wars and The Rise of Skywalker. I've seen a lot of the TV shows. I've played a few of the games. I've read none of the books. So, that's where I'm coming from - i.e. I'm probably missing a bunch of expanded universe crud where this stuff has already been explored.

Just a few sketches of the accursed family line...

Anakin Skywalker:

* bright young kid with a traumatic & abusive childhood
* became an angsty and insufferable teen slathering his trauma on every surface
* had a weird May-September romance with Padm√© Amidala and she gets to die as a reward for it
* became a school shooter
* became Darth Vader, helped empower Emperor Palpatine (a.k.a. Darth Sidious)
* blew up the whole-ass planet of Alderaan and it's entire population of 2 billion people - I mean you don't really come back from that kind of shit
* he had a moment of redemption by throwing Palpatine down a well, which somehow let him appear as a "good" ghost after death - but he did an unforgivable amount of damage to the universe up to that point.

Luke Skywalker:

* an angsty and insufferable teen - but apparently not so much with the trauma as an explanation?
* he could have just grown up as a moisture farmer, but the family legacy came for him anyway
* Yoda tried to fuck him up with Jedi training to squash his care for [[found family]], but he resisted and his incomplete training kind of screwed him
* Darth Vader tried to fuck him up, but he resisted and lost a hand
* Luke helped tear down his family's tradition of fucking up the galaxy, which is kind of redemption for the Skywalkers overall
* But then, Luke fucks up Ben Solo, re-igniting the whole damn mess again
* Luke tries one more time to help fix shit, mostly succeeds, lets himself die in the process - which I think is the most heroic thing any Skywalker has ever done

Kylo Ren (a.k.a. Ben Solo, son of Leia Skywalker Organa):

* idolized his grandfather Darth Vader, but mainly the pre-redemption Vader
* an angsty and insufferable teen slathering his trauma on every surface
* and a good chunk of that trauma came from how Luke Skywalker fucked him up
* he stabs his father Han Solo (a non-Skywalker) - Skywalkers ruin everything
* killed Snoke, his emperor-equivalent, but then basically slides into the throne himself and has no notion of redemption
* I haven't seen Rise of Skywalker yet, so maybe some other shit happens there

Rey Skywalker:

* initially I thought she'd be the beginning of the end of the whole Skywalker / Palpatine mess
* I haven't seen Rise of Skywalker - apparently she's the grand daughter of Emperor Palpatine?
* I heard she adopted the Skywalker name, which is just unfortunate. She would've been better off discarding all association with lineage and legacy, as far as I'm concerned.
* maybe she brought balance to the Force?
* who knows, she's probably going to fuck it all up because she's a Skywalker now

Just from these examples, I think the galaxy would be a far better place if it saw the back of the Skywalker legacy for the rest of time.

Beyond the Skywalkers, there's the Jedi & Sith. I should probably google a bit here, since I'm sure there Has Already Been Discourse On These Matters Of Space Wizards.

But, in a nutshell:

* The Jedi - love & passion are the gateway to calamity, so one must become an asshole
* The Sith - love & passion are compelling reasons to just cut loose as an asshole

What if the Force doesn't really have a Light Side and a Dark Side? What if it's just like fire & electricity & nuclear reactions - a force of nature without intent, coerced into meaningful shapes by sentient constructs? What if an altogether different pattern is possible?

I grew up in the Cold War, America vs Russia. As a grown up, I tend to think America & Russia are just two sides of the same histoplasmosis-infected coin. I can only imagine how tired the rest of the world is with our shenanigans. I like to imagine a Star Wars galaxy that would give huge sighs of relief if they could be rid of the whole Jedi vs Sith complex.

I'd love to see a Star Wars galaxy where Broom Boys and Force Witches and Mandalorians and Nerf Herders - all without the benefit of breeding - wrest control of The Force from bickering Space Wizards and try to found a more hopeful future where the Skywalker name is properly scorned for all the havoc it caused.
