From [[Confessions of a Serial Enthusiast|https://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast/]], a blog post I wrote back in May 2006

I've flitted from nano-project to nano-project, a hack here and a hack there. But, other than in projects where someone's expecting something from me and (preferrably) paying me - I have a very fickle attention span. If you hire me, or have me sign a contract, I'll stick to schedule and deliver as best I can - no worries about that. When I'm in "professional mode," I run on different premises and motivations. But, left to my own devices, I will freewheel and wander between a slew of part-time obsessions.
