* Hello world
* I haven't tried [[Streaming]] in about a month
** I'd intended to fire up a workbench stream a few weeks ago, but that weekend was when the George Floyd protests started up
** Feel anxious about streaming anyway, figured the world didn't need to hear from me right now, so I skipped
* Not entirely sure where today went. Spent a couple hours in the basement at the workbench rebuilding the streaming PC.
** Tried swapping the GPU out for a USB 3.0 expansion card for all the cameras
** Turns out that GPU was doing a lot, since CPU usage went up to like 70% and FPS in OBS dropped to 15
** Tried using a spare RX 480 that I'd upgraded from in my game PC, but TransTrum just seems not to recognize it at all
** Had a spare Radeon 7800 that the RX 480 had replaced, and that seemed to work
* Then, drinks with the girl and dinner. Measured skylights for new blinds.
* Procrastinating exercise bike & shower before bed, scrolling through tiktok and twitter
