Been working, playing [[EVE Echoes]], and started soaking my head in [[SunVox]].

As mentioned on [[2020 / 09 / 04]], I got a notion to take a break from my video game tinkerings to throw together a small graphics & audio demo in the spirit of the Swinth Demo from the C64 days.

Well, I've made progress. So far, I've got a simple cover of the first song mostly done - Theme from Stationary Ark. I glued [[my glowy vector line drawing|WGL6100]] together with the [[SunVox]] JS library and [[got something pleasant working|https://lmorchard.github.io/swinth2020/index.html]]. Here's [[the source code on GitHub||https://github.com/lmorchard/swinth2020/]].
