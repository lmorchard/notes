* Hello world.
* [[Coronavirus Brings American Decline Out in the Open|https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-06-29/coronavirus-brings-american-decline-out-in-the-open]]
** That thing with the "heirloom-quality tools" I was talking about [[yesterday|2020 / 07 / 01]]. This is pretty much that.
* Jason Kottke - [[Apart Together|https://kottke.org/20/07/apart-together]]
** "October 31, 2000 was the last day all humans were together on Earth."
** There's a notion I've seen now and then in sci-fi stories where, among all the other galactic species, future humans are the ones known for being essentially native to space.
** That is, humans have a home planet but they're far more known for their ships and stations.
** I'm trying to remember which sci-fi franchises do this.
** But, the optimism of it makes me weepy every time I run into it.

** "This is my favourite thing about SVG animation. Not mouse movement in particular, but interactivity. Exporting animation as an mp4 is cool and all. But you can't play with it."
** Really neat stuff interacting with SVGs
* [[2020 Reset64 4kb 'Craptastic' Game Compo|https://reset64-magazine.itch.io/2020-reset64-4kb-craptastic-game-compo]]
** "It certainly doesn’t mean crap, although it can! Craptastic can mean ludicrous, bonkers, outrageous, funny, wacky, far out, and silly. The theme simply implies that the compo was just for a bit of fun, not a serious coding competition."
* [[Where to watch H&I|https://www.handitv.com/wheretowatch/]]
** Gee, I really wish Oregon had an over the air station carrying Heroes & Icons
** I miss it from the Detroit area. Had a great summer of binge watching all Star Trek series ever with my TV antenna.
* [[Review of the fantastically complicated 9Barista stovetop espresso machine|https://boingboing.net/2020/07/02/review-of-the-fantastically-co.html]]
** I think I might need this espresso machine just for the geegaw of it
** [[It's $385|https://9barista.com/product/9barista-espresso-machine/]], which is just a //little// gratuitous
* [[I spent a month away from Animal Crossing and now everything is different|https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/2/21310617/animal-crossing-new-horizons-abanoned-island-summer-update]]
** Kind of dreading visiting my Animal Crossing island now after like a 6 week intensive every day obsessive play streak
* [[Fred Schneider on Conan O'Brien 1995|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWbmPHx5R2Q]]
** This starts slow but dang, it heats up
* RSS readers - build or buy?
** [[I've been building a new one.|https://github.com/lmorchard/easy-feed-oven]] Because that's a thing I do.
** [[Newsblur|https://newsblur.com/]] is good though
** So is [[Feedly|https://feedly.com/i/welcome]]
** So is [[Inoreader|https://www.inoreader.com/]]
** Maybe if or when my enthusiasm for my latest build has vanished, I should consider buying into one of the above

** "Subscribe to your favorite sources using an RSS reader."
** "Quickly triage incoming information multiple times per day."
** "Make use of read-it-later apps and buy an e-ink reader to have disconnected time dedicated to reading."
** "Create extensive highlights and take notes while reading."
* [[Roy Fielding's Misappropriated REST Dissertation |https://twobithistory.org/2020/06/28/rest.html]]
** "They could have called their approach Fuck It, Overload HTTP (FIOH), and that would have been an accurate name, as anyone who has ever tried to decide what HTTP status code to return for a business logic error can attest."
** "This is why, rather than saying that nobody understands REST, we should just think of the term “REST” as having been misappropriated. The modern notion of a REST API has historical links to Fielding’s REST architecture, but really the two things are separate. The historical link is good to keep in mind as a guide for when to build a RESTful API. Does your API cross organizational and national boundaries the same way that HTTP needs to? Then building a RESTful API with a predictable, uniform interface might be the right approach. If not, it’s good to remember that Fielding favored having form follow function. Maybe something like GraphQL or even just JSON-RPC would be a better fit for what you are trying to accomplish."
