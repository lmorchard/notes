** "October 31, 2000 was the last day all humans were together on Earth."
** There's a notion I've seen now and then in sci-fi stories where, among all the other galactic species, future humans are the ones known for being essentially native to space.
** That is, humans have a home planet but they're far more known for their ships and stations.
** I'm trying to remember which sci-fi franchises do this.
** But, the optimism of it makes me weepy every time I run into it.

** I think I might need this espresso machine just for the geegaw of it
