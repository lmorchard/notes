* Hello world.
* [[Coronavirus Brings American Decline Out in the Open|https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-06-29/coronavirus-brings-american-decline-out-in-the-open]]
** That thing with the "heirloom-quality tools" I was talking about [[yesterday|2020 / 07 / 01]]. This is pretty much that.
* Jason Kottke - [[Apart Together|https://kottke.org/20/07/apart-together]]
** "October 31, 2000 was the last day all humans were together on Earth."
** There's a notion I've seen now and then in sci-fi stories where, among all the other galactic species, future humans are the ones known for being essentially native to space.
** That is, humans have a home planet but they're far more known for their ships and stations.
** I'm trying to remember which sci-fi franchises do this.
** But, the optimism of it makes me weepy every time I run into it.
* [[Where to watch H&I|https://www.handitv.com/wheretowatch/]]
** Gee, I really wish Oregon had an over the air station carrying Heroes & Icons
** I miss it from the Detroit area. Had a great summer of binge watching all Star Trek series ever with my TV antenna.
* [[Review of the fantastically complicated 9Barista stovetop espresso machine|https://boingboing.net/2020/07/02/review-of-the-fantastically-co.html]]
** I think I might need this espresso machine just for the geegaw of it
** [[It's $385|https://9barista.com/product/9barista-espresso-machine/]], which is just a //little// gratuitous
* [[I spent a month away from Animal Crossing and now everything is different|https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/2/21310617/animal-crossing-new-horizons-abanoned-island-summer-update]]
** Kind of dreading visiting my Animal Crossing island now after like a 6 week intensive every day obsessive play streak
* [[Fred Schneider on Conan O'Brien 1995|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWbmPHx5R2Q]]
** This starts slow but dang, it heats up
* RSS readers - build or buy?
** [[I've been building a new one.|https://github.com/lmorchard/easy-feed-oven]] Because that's a thing I do.
** [[Newsblur|https://newsblur.com/]] is good though
** So is [[Feedly|https://feedly.com/i/welcome]]
** So is [[Inoreader|https://www.inoreader.com/]]
** Maybe if or when my enthusiasm for my latest build has vanished, I should consider buying into one of the above
