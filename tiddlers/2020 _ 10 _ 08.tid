Take a moment and think about this super power: if you write vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS, all you have to do is put that code in a web browser and it runs. Edit a file, refresh the page, youâ€™ve got a feedback cycle.

This is pretty much where all my headspace is on webdev side projects, these days. If I can: No tooling. No bundles. Maybe a script to copy some files around. Otherwise, just ES6 modules, CSS with variables, plain HTML. Few dependencies if any - ideally just included straight from a vendor directory or [[unpkg|https://unpkg.com/]] URLs.
