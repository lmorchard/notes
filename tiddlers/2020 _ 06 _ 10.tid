* Oh hey, I forgot about this card-sorting demo with web components that I hacked on awhile ago - https://glitch.com/~wc-arboretum
* Good morning
* Watching work-sponsored lecture by [[Dr. Robin DiAngelo|https://robindiangelo.com/]] on White Fragility
** This particular live lecture is privately offered, but another video for later: https://youtu.be/DwIx3KQer54
** Also [[Dr. Robin DiAngelo discusses 'White Fragility'|https://youtu.be/45ey4jgoxeU]]
** "building the stamina to withstand the challenge to privilege that's never before been seriously questioned"
** The inability to tolerate the racial stress of a challenge to our positions or perspectives
** White fragility functions to block the challenge and regain white racial equilibrium
** White fragility is not a weakness per se - it's a means to maintain dominance and deflect challenge
