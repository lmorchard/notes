title: reserve power at home
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Power outages quickly become problematic. It would be nice to have an option for reserve power at home when that happens.

Most outages seem to last about a day. I have been through a week-long outage at least once in my life. Would like a lot of spare capacity, though. Does "a lot" mean three days, one week, two weeks, a month? What's the order of magnitude of expense between each versus the likelihood of needing the contingency?

Endangered essentials roughly include:

* refrigerator
* freezer
* my CPAP at night
* furnace
* AC
* lights
* phone charging
* laptop charging

On generators:

* I've had one before, I don't have one now.
* Generators go outside, are noisy, can attract attention, can be stolen.
* Needs fuel that can be hard to keep on hand and fresh.
* Acquiring fuel leads to contending with others who also need fuel
** at best, a long wait at gas station
** at worst, getting stuck in a crowd where bad things happen.
* I know there are permanent installation gas whole-house backup generators, but those are spendy.
* Fuel options
** Gasoline - gas station within walking distance, but it goes stale
** Propane - never dealt with it. Does it go stale? Dangerous to keep around?
** House gas line - assuming it's still working during power outage, possible for a temporary hookup to a portable generator? Bad idea?
*** Grill line is probably too small, need special attention to the pressure draw of the generator and ensure it doesn't starve other things in the house

On batteries:

* Haven't dealt with them with respect to a whole-house AC scenario
* Seems like batteries are nice to keep topped up so that when the supply goes out, they're ready to be used. 
* Batteries need maintenance - not sure of particulars, would imagine not as bad as keeping fuel on hand?
* More expensive than generator + fuel?
* Shopping ideas?

On solar:

* Have never dealt with solar.
* Short of a major project on the roof, would it be useful to have a few panels to put outside in a pinch to bolster batteries?

Hybrid notions:

* A few days' worth of battery storage to give breathing room?
* A fuel-flexible generator to support batteries when fuel is more easily acquired?
* Would like to be able to shelter-in-place and lay low during instability events for as long as possible to avoid crowds, panic, and rushed thinking
* Some solar panels to charge as possible?


Random notes & links, which are probably inaccurate as heck:

* [[Tesla Powerwall|https://www.tesla.com/powerwall/design]] - 1 day backup - $12,000. Add 2 more days with solar for $16,400 more.
* [[Generac|https://airplusair.com/2020/12/22/home-generators-vs-battery-backup-power-systems/]] - $9999, 18kWh, 9kW, 50A
