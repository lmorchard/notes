* Hello world.
* It's technically today, though I haven't actually yet gone to bed since yesterday. I'll probably do that soon, though.
* [[my brain is a chinese room]]
** a notion that kept me from going to bed right away

** "Doomscrolling will never actually stop the doom itself. Feeling informed can be a salve, but being overwhelmed by tragedy serves no purpose. The current year is nothing if not a marathon; trying to sprint to the end of one’s feed will only cause burnout and a decline in mental health among the people whose level-headedness is needed most. That means you, dear reader. Amidst all of the pain, isolation, and destruction of the past six months, it’s not worth it to add on to the strain with two hours of excess Twitter every night. Perhaps now just needs to be the End Times for your timeline."

* The Verge: "[[There are more streaming choices than ever — why are prices going up?|https://www.theverge.com/21310442/tv-streaming-youtube-fubo-price-increases-carrier-fees-disputes-costs-cable-television?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4]]"
** "The problem lies in the fact that all of these companies — internet TV and cable alike — aren’t really fighting with each other to keep prices down. They’re fighting with content providers... And they do not like to license their content cheaply."
** [[We haven't had cable in our house for about 12 years]]. Just internet.
