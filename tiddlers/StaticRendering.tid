I am producing a static rendering of this wiki and publishing it to a web site.

!! In a nutshell

* [[These are the NPM scripts I use|https://github.com/lmorchard/notes/blob/master/package.json#L6]]. 
* My workbench computer ([[TransTrum]]) runs the server with `npm run start` for my personal note-taking use.
* It has a scheduled cronjob that runs `npm run backup` every 10 minutes:
** backs up the notes to the github repository,
* There's also a Github Action workflow 
** https://github.com/lmorchard/notes/blob/master/.github/workflows/prod.yml
** builds the static site
** uploads the result to AWS S3

!! To Do

* Add a last-modified date to the static pages
* Search around here might be nice - I can do it from Tiddlywiki, the authoring environment, but having it on the static site would be nice
* HomePage columns?
* Make [[the static rendering template|https://github.com/lmorchard/notes/blob/master/tiddlers/lmo-static-html.tid]] less funky?
** I don't really understand TiddlyWiki macros & widgets & pragmas & etc yet - this is kind of copypasta'd from other templates until it seemed to work
* Would it be interesting to whitelist or blacklist published pages by tag?
* Might be neat to have a "now" page listing things I'm up to right now. That, and / or have a big panel added to my AboutMePage
* An RSS feed of RecentChanges could be nice
* An RSS feed of AllJournals
** But maybe hold back //today// until tomorrow, when it's "done"
** Not quite a blog, maybe a daybook? Kind of a blog
