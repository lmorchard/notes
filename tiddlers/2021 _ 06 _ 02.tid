Filled up the Field Notes in my wallet last week. I use it as a kind of personally-tweaked [[Bullet Journal]]. So, I flipped through it to see what loose ends and to-dos were left hanging. Also tried lifting out all the [[things I might do]] into this wiki.

I'm inconstant with this stuff. Sometimes I get a spike of enthusiasm to do it. Sometimes I neglect it. I'm trying to get more accepting of my inconsistency and think about how to work more cooperatively with my [[random pen-plotter brain| my brain is a pen plotter drawing unoptimized paths]].
