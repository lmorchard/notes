* Good afternoon
* In kind of an unfocused daze today, hoping to snag my brain on something
* Thinking about [[GameDev]] again, maybe need to learn [[Godot]]
** I tend to avoid GameDev not involving WebDev - because usually I'm trying to learn some web technologies from the attempt to build a game that I'll probably never finish
** But, you know, I don't really play many games on the web
* Set up notes.lmorchard.com in AWS and a Github Action to deploy StaticRendering on merge to master
