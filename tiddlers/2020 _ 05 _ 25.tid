Hey, so remember to measure windows and order blinds.

I should shop for a BBQ grill for the back yard. We sold ours when we moved across the country.

I should write about how to build an [[Easy-Blog Oven]]

I should write a tool to maintain hashes and only upload changes to S3

I should write a post about how i used aerostat to host WordPress at home
