title: DIY WIFI BBQ thermometer
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Not a terribly original project, but spending Saturdays grilling has me thinking I might want to get into more smoking and keep track of temperatures better.

Seems like a semi-simple thing to do with parts like:

* ESP8266 - have one of these spare
* A display would be nice
* An [[ESP32 with integrated display|https://www.banggood.com/ESP32-OLED-Module-ESP32-OLED-WiFi-bluetooth-Dual-ESP-32-ESP-32S-ESP8266-p-1148119.html?akmClientCountry=America&p=MA240439985285201910&cur_warehouse=CN]] could be really handy
* [[K-type thermocouple probes|http://www.amazon.com/Probe-Thermocouple-Sensor-Temperature-Controller/dp/B00899A4LY/]] At least 2 - one for food, one for grill. These seem semi-consumable and go bad after awhile, so best to use the pluggable ones
* 2.5mm mono jacks for the thermocouples - I have lots of those
* [[MAX6675|https://www.amazon.com/SainSmart-MAX6675-Thermocouple-Temperature-0-1024%E2%84%83/dp/B00PVTH4MW]] temperature to SPI interface
* [[DHT22|https://www.adafruit.com/product/385]] for external temp & humidity? Probably overkill
* [[Waterproof project case|https://www.ebay.com/itm/Waterproof-Clear-Electronic-Project-Box-Enclosure-Cover-Plastic-Case-158x90x60mm/174294465357?hash=item2894c27b4d:g:~bkAAOSwx9xey4RZ]]?

I can write simple firmware - like my WIFI pumpkin - though getting even fancier with IoT integration could be fun

Something like a PID and a fan could be interesting for temperature control. But all I have is a little Weber charcoal kettle, so that's really over-complicating things. Also I'm not really all that skilled or advanced at the grill yet, so a semi-accurate thermometer would be a huge upgrade as it is ðŸ˜…
