						<p>When I'm feeling all <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Dread%2520Pirate%2520Roberts.html">Dread Pirate Roberts</a> about some software, I sometimes reinvent it myself. Occasionally well, often badly. I tend to learn things, though.</p><p>A particular thing I often learn is that whomever came up with the software did a lot of thinking. And they made their best effort.</p><p>And if / when I reinvent my own version for the same problem set, I bang my head into a bunch of things. And then I realize that what I thought was weird in the other software turned out that way for fully understandable reasons. Often good reasons.</p><p>Practically never because, say, <em>I'm smarter than the person who wrote that other software</em> and have noticed something they didn't.</p><p>So, I often ask myself &quot;how else would you have done it?&quot; Like, how else in the universe might this thing have come together?</p><p>Maybe, rarely, occasionally do I have an actually good idea.</p>
