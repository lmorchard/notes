						<ul><li>Last night in Portland was something.<ul><li>Big protest march passed by my house, a few blocks away on MLK. Seemed like a few thousand people.</li><li>I wasn't there. I don't really know what happened on the ground other than what I saw on live streams.</li><li>Folks continued to downtown, where they ended up across an intersection from a line of police.</li><li>Seemed like a standoff held for about 10 minutes before the police fired tear gas across the intersection</li><li>Protestors then scattered like dandelion seeds. Some went straight to the court house, others to the mall.</li><li>Not sure what triggered the tear gas. Police seemed scarce after that.</li><li>Will be curious to see analysis in the coming days.</li></ul></li><li>The replacement button for my right joy con arrived today.<ul><li>Thinking about streaming the repair process today.</li></ul></li><li>But first, I'm watching the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="SpaceX.html">SpaceX</a> launch.<ul><li>There are abundant problems in the world and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="SpaceX.html">SpaceX</a> is problematic, but I am almost physically incapable of not being captivated by a space launch</li><li>They did go to space today</li></ul></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="I%2520seem%2520to%2520be%2520okay%2520with%2520property%2520damage%2520during%2520protests.html">I seem to be okay with property damage during protests</a> - why is that?</li><li>More protests and riots and police over-reaction today</li><li>We masked up and went out to the liquor store to restock the bar. Afterward, we picked up burritos. The first time for both of these things in about 3 months I think. It went okay, but we were nervous.</li><li>Afterward, drinks and dinner with the girl. More riots on TV.</li><li>Then, finally, I went to the basement to repair the broken button on my joycon and finish up the en-purpling<ul><li>I managed to crudely attach the new R button micro-switch.</li><li>The old switch tore off the motherboard along with the solder pads.</li><li>I think I somehow managed to bridge enough solder over to exposed traces to hook the button up to the circuit.</li><li>Got everything back together and played 20 minutes of Animal Crossing, everything worked!</li></ul></li><li>I'm relieved that I managed to finish the project and now the joycon works again<ul><li>I'm annoyed that I'm not as happy about this success than I was sad about the earlier failures.</li><li>Like, I did it. I fixed it. I have two great purple joy cons that work.</li><li>But I'm not ecstatic. I'm just relieved.</li><li>Earlier I was sad and disappointed and a little depressed.</li><li>I really wish I could get my brain to work another way.</li><li>So, I'm just kind of keep looking at what I did and trying to will myself to celebrate.</li></ul></li></ul>
