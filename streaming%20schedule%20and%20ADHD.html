						<p>I like <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Streaming.html">Streaming</a>. I think I have <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="ADHD.html">ADHD</a>.</p><p>The latter seems to make it difficult for me to consistently schedule the former. And I have a notion that consistent scheduling is key to having a stream that people actually come around to watch.</p><p>Maybe that's not essential? Maybe a stream that just appears occasionally at random is fine?</p><p>On the other hand, maybe I should consider something more async like producing <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="YouTube.html">YouTube</a> videos?</p><p>But, if I get into considering <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="YouTube.html">YouTube</a> videos, that takes away some of the appeal of streaming: Mainly, that I can just turn it on while I do a thing and not worry about editing or cleaning it up later.</p><p>If I produce a video or a podcast, I'll want it to be well produced and better planned.</p><p>Also, an async thing misses some of the vague live social contact that seems nice about streaming. Not that many folks show up when I stream right now anyway (see: scheduling) but it is nice to occasionally have company in a distanced way that only triggers a muted <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="social%2520anxiety.html">social anxiety</a> response.</p><p>Maybe a consistent schedule isn't as important as <em>any</em> schedule. As in, I somehow announce and plan a stream a few days in advance and then go do it. That's still a challenge to my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="ADHD.html">ADHD</a> brain, to plan &amp; commit to a future event, but it might be easier than trying to pursue a consistent drumbeat of a schedule.</p><p>Along with all of this, I should note current events: The world's in a bit of a state. There are protests and folks with things to say. Seems kind of &quot;off topic&quot; right now for me to try streaming workbench and code tinkerings in and amidst all this. And I'm not sure I have anything useful to add to this conversation. So I'm also thinking that this has turned into a not great time to stream my garbage?
